It stimulates your thoughts, emotions, and makes you feel like you\'re there. When I think of art, I think of something that you feel when you see it. When you play a game that makes you think, you become a part of the game. It makes you feel like you are there, like those characters are your friends and you are in that world.

I was in my early teens. There was a relatively new game in the arcade. It was a horror game. I was a huge fan of horror movies and so I was very excited about this game. The player character was a woman in a nightgown, and she had to walk from one side of the screen to the other. The screen was split in half by a wall. To get past each half of the screen you had to step over the wall. The woman could be killed in the game by zombies, ghosts, and other monsters. As she walked, she would be chased by different monsters. If she could not get over the wall, she would be killed.\n\nI was fascinated by the game and I would play it whenever I had the chance. I would watch people play it and I would try to see how it worked. I would spend as much time as I could watching people play it.\n\nThe graphics were very crude by today's standards, but I didn't mind. The game was very atmospheric and tense. The way the creatures moved just felt right. I would play the game for a few minutes and then head to the snack bar to get a soda. I would always finish my soda, and then I would return to the game. I would play the game for as long as I was allowed. There was a time limit, but I didn't care. I just loved watching the game.\n\nAs I played the game I would get a sense of it's artistic qualities. I started to see the game as a work of art. The game was gorgeous and atmospheric. I could feel the tension. It was an experience that I didn't want to end. The game was so captivating and gave me such a sense of suspense. The game was scary, but that didn't bother me. I was just having fun.\n\nI don't think that the game would get high marks on an artistic scale, but it was art to me. It made me feel something. It gave me an experience, and that is what art does. The game was just a game, but it was a work of art to me.\n\nResearcher: How did you experience the game as art?\n\nParticipant: The game was atmospheric and suspenseful. It made me feel tense. I could feel the horror. The game was designed with a lot of thought and")

However, I feel in some sense it's an accurate metaphor.\n\nI think of art as something that touches my soul, something that can make me feel, something that can make me think, something that can move me, something that can take me to a different place. Something that I can think about after the fact and consider why I felt the way I did.\n\nI can't help but feel that games can bring out such things in a person. I always look back on the games I play and think about the experience I had while playing it. That's why I think of games as art.\n\nResearcher: Please describe in a few words how you felt about this experience.\n\nParticipant: I felt reallyâ€¦ moved.\n\nResearcher: Please describe in a few words what you thought about this experience.\n\nParticipant: I thought about the story, the way it was told, and the experience I had while playing it, and I thought about how it was different from other games I've played.\n\nResearcher: Do you think there is anything that makes these experiences of digital games as art different from other experiences of art in other media?\n\nParticipant: Well, I think movies are art, and you can certainly get some pretty deep and moving experiences from them. But I think the way you interact with games, and how they're built, makes them a unique art form.\n\nResearcher: Do you think a digital game can be art if it doesn't provoke such experiences in a person?\n\nParticipant: I don't think it can be art if it doesn't provoke such experiences.\n\nResearcher: Do you think a digital game can be art even if it is not made by an artist?\n\nParticipant: I think so.

I think a game like Journey fits in the concept of art. It is not about the game itself, but it is about the impression it leaves on me and the thoughts it makes me think. The game is a journey, where you walk through a vast desert. The world of the game is bright and colourful, even though there is not much to see. The game is mysterious, and you don't know what you are looking for. You just walk through the desert. The only way to know your position is by a marker on the ground. You walk across this vast world, but there is only the marker on the ground to tell you where you are. At some points, you meet other players on your journey. I really loved that in the game. You were never sure what the other player would do, so you had to be very careful. If you met each other, you could also help each other. The game feels a bit like an art installation. There just is the game and you. You walk through this world, and you experience the game. The game is about being there and experiencing the world, not about solving puzzles or getting a goal.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for bringing this experience to my attention.

For example, I look at a game like Journey as a piece of art. It is a game that actually has no conflict in it. It is a game that is made for you to go through a journey. The music is very enchanting, and it makes me feel like life is more than just surviving, there is some sort of meaning in it.\n\nResearcher: How do you perceive the experience of playing Journey?\n\nParticipant: It is like you are floating along a stream of water.

It makes me feel like I am actually here. When I first played Journey, I played it for about a week straight. I just got lost in it. I just went to work, and when I had breaks, I would go play the game again. That is how much I got lost in that game. It makes me feel like I am part of it. I am flying through the air, and I am seeing all these wonderful things.\n\nResearcher: In what way does Journey make you feel connected to the world?\n\nParticipant: It makes me feel like I am part of the world.

My favorite part of the game was the end, when you go to the mountaintop and you see the sun rising. That moment was beautiful.\n\nResearcher: Would you consider yourself a more frequent player of games or more of a player of art?\n\nParticipant: Games\n\nResearcher: If you compare Journey to other games you've played in the past, what makes it unique? What made it especially memorable to you?\n\nParticipant: I think the thing that made it memorable to me was the experience of playing it with other people. I love the feeling of playing with other people, especially when the game is not very challenging (as Journey is). I love the sense of companionship and togetherness.\n\nResearcher: How did this experience affect your perception of games?\n\nParticipant: I realized that games can tell a story and that they can be emotional. I think this experience helped me realize that games are a form of art.\n\nResearcher: Could you give a few examples of art-games you have experienced? Can you name a few games that were particularly memorable to you?\n\nParticipant: I loved the Flower (2009) demo. It was an emotional journey, I felt so connected to the flower. It was the first video game I've played that made me cry\n\nResearcher: What was it about Flower that made you cry?\n\nParticipant: I think it was the fact that I was connected to this flower, and I wanted to see it grow and bloom. I did not want it to die.\n\nResearcher: What are some other games you have experienced?\n\nParticipant: I really loved Journey, it was an amazing experience. I also loved the game The Last Of Us (2013).

The game had a large impact on me. There are parts in the game that are very hard to understand your environment and the exact way of moving forward. It was very challenging, and sometimes I felt a little frustrated. When I finally reached the end, I realized that the game was more than just about solving puzzles, it was about emotions. The game had done a great job to build up the mood, and it was very touching.\n\nResearcher: Why do you think this game experience was art? What made it art for you?\n\nParticipant: Well, the game made me feel like I was playing a piece of art. It has a story, which you can't understand by just looking at the game. You need to interact with the environment to get to know the story behind Limbo. The game is like an art piece, in which you can interact to get a better understanding of the piece.\n\nResearcher: Did you experience any kind of emotional or physical response to this game?\n\nParticipant: Yes, there were a couple of moments where I felt really emotional. But also there were moments where I was very happy with the progress I made. I didn't really have any physical response to the game.\n\nResearcher: What did you like about that experience?\n\nParticipant: I liked that the game was so different from other games. It was different in the way that you can't really get a deeper understanding of the game by just playing it, you need to interact with the environment. The game is a piece of art, and it was very nice to experience it as art.\n\nResearcher: Do you think that this game will always be art for you?\n\nParticipant: Yes, I think so. I'll never forget this game, and it probably will always be a piece of art to me.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much for your time!\n\nParticipant: You're welcome, I hope it was useful!\n\nAfter the interview the researcher asked me if it was okay to publish the interview on the blog.

It was different from other games we play, as it didn\'t have action. It used a different type of storytelling and the gameplay was designed to explore the characters\' feelings and decision-making. It used different types of emotions such as fear, sadness, and hope, which I haven\'t seen in any other game.\n\nResearcher: Thank you. Can you please tell us, in a few sentences, why you think this experience was art?\n\nParticipant: To me, art is any physical or conceptual activity that is meant to be appreciated.

I was watching PewDiePie play the game Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The atmosphere of the game was very well done, and I couldn't help but to feel that the game was telling a story. The game gave me the feeling that I was playing a horror movie, and the game was doing a great job at giving the player that feeling. The game was very immersive, and I was immersed in it. I felt that it was art in the way that the game was being played.\n\nThe second time was while I was playing The Last of Us. I was playing the game for the first time and I was playing the campaign mode. The game was very immersive, and I felt like I was in the game. The game was a masterpiece. The voice acting was superb, and the game was incredibly well-spoken. The graphics were incredible, and the story and the characters were very realistic. The game was one of the best games I ever played, and it was so well done that I felt that the game was art in its own way. The game was telling a story that makes you think, and it will have you on the edge of your seat. The story is so great that you will find yourself caring about the characters and what happens to them.

And when I think of art in a video game, I think of the aesthetics, the music, the sound effects, the story, and the gameplay. The game that I experienced as art is called Journey. This game was developed by thatgamecompany and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, and it was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2012.\n\nJourney is a cooperative multiplayer game. The player travels through a vast desert with a scarf floating behind them. The scarf follows the player as they move and it can pick up items that the player picks up. The player can also sing into the scarf to emit a high-pitched tone. This tone can be used to call for help or to let the player know where they are. The point of the game is to help the other player get to the mountain in the distance. There is no dialogue in the game, and the only way to communicate with the other player is through singing.\n\nThe game is very serene and peaceful. The other player is represented by a white scarf and the player is represented by a blue scarf. In the beginning, the player does not see the other player, but the player can still feel the presence of the other player. The player can hear the other player's footsteps and singing. The player follows the other's path, and the two players essentially grow together in the game. I played this game with my brother and we both felt the presence of the other player. Our paths crossed and we both felt happy to see the other player. We were both happy to be working together to reach the end. The end of the game is to reach the mountain, and the player sings to tell the other player that they have made it. The player and the other player feel like they have accomplished something together. The game is very enjoyable to play with others.\n\nI played this game by myself a few times, and it was still enjoyable to play. But the game really shines when you play it with someone else. The game is very unique, and it was a very unique experience. The game is also very artistic and the art style is amazing. The graphics are very nice and the art style is very unique. I really enjoyed playing this game and I would play it again. I love the feeling of progression")

The game was very strange. I was taken aback by its presentation at first, but I figured it was just one of those artsy games that tries to do something different. It was the story and the music that really sold me. It was the story of a manâ€™s life and his journey through it. The game started with a voice over describing the island you would be exploring. The narrator was a man, who was talking about the island, like it was a person. His voice was calm and quiet, but it was very clear and distinct. It felt like he was talking to me. The graphics were very simple, but each scene moved in a way that made me feel I was on a real island. I felt like I was exploring a place I had never been to before. The music was a choral piece that was very soothing, but it still sounded beautiful and sad. I could feel the emotion and the passion in the music. I was very moved by the game. It was the best experience I have ever had in a game. I would say it felt like a beautiful painting, but it was more than that. It felt like I was walking through a memory.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your honest answer.

Thanks for inviting me.\n\nThe results are quite promising, and the participants seem happy to be part of the research. They seem to feel a strong connection to the game and its developers. A lot of them seem to be quite aware of the existence of video games as art, which is important for this study. There is some variation between the responses, and I am interested in seeing if this will be clear in the data. The responses also seem quite unique. It seems that the developers can create games with different approaches, and the playerâ€™s experiences can be equally diverse.')

I had been killing guards and soldiers left and right, and at some point I was running away from the soldiers, and they were shooting at me. I was crouched behind a wall and they were shooting at me, but it was easy enough to avoid them. Then, I saw one of the soldiers get shot in the head. He was killed instantly. Seeing this happen to this soldier was completely unexpected. I realized that I had killed him. I had made a choice that caused his death. This was a turning point for me. I realized that I was killing innocent people in this game. I was responsible for so many deaths in this game, but seeing this one soldier die was the first time I really experienced what it would be like to kill someone. I had killed hundreds of people before, but I had never really thought about it. Seeing this one person die made me realize that I had killed hundreds of people in the game. After this moment, I was no longer able to ignore the fact that I was killing people in this game. I was seeing the consequences of my actions, and I started to feel terrible about killing people.

I believe I experienced a digital game as art when I played a particular level in the first-person shooter game Half-Life 2. This level is called "Follow Freeman!" and is the fifth chapter of the game. It is set in a part of the city of City 17 that is being attacked by the Combine (the antagonistic force in the Half-Life series), and the player has to move through the streets as quickly as possible while being attacked by a relatively high number of enemies.\n\nThe first time I played this level, I did not proceed very far. In fact, I only played the level for about ten minutes. I became frustrated with the amount of enemies that were attacking me, and I also did not like how the level was structured. I felt that it was not very fun to play, mainly because it was not very clear to me what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to get through the level. I tried to move through the streets as fast as possible, but I was stopped by many enemies (and I even died a few times because I could not react quickly enough). The reason I forgot this level so soon is probably because I did not enjoy the experience. I felt that the level was a bit too hard for me and not enjoyable at all. I was not sure what to do or how to get through the level, and I did not like how the level was structured. I did not like how I had to move through the streets as quickly as possible and be attacked by a relatively high number of enemies. I felt that the level was a bit too hard for me and not enjoyable at all. I was not sure what to do or how to get through the level, and I did not like how the level was structured.\n\nHowever, when I played the level again a week later, I had a very different experience. I played the level for about two hours and loved every minute of it. This time, I did not mind that I had to move through the streets as quickly as possible and be attacked by a relatively high number of enemies. I actually enjoyed it. I think this is because I had more experience with the game, so it was easier for me to play. I also think it\'s because I had more experience with this level in particular, so I knew what to expect and how to approach it. The level also seemed less')

I played a lot of games on the GameBoy, and I had a lot of fun with them. But there was one game in particular that left a lasting impression on me. It didn't have a name, it was just referred to as 'that game.'\n\nThe gameplay was simple. There was a ball that moved through a maze, and I had to stop it by drawing the walls of the maze. I could get a new colour by pressing the R button, and the colour I drew would have an effect on the ball.\n\nIt sounds pretty simplistic, but the game was very hard to beat.

I can't remember what happened when I finally managed to beat the game, but I remember it being a very satisfying feeling.\n\nResearcher: What did that game mean to you? How did it make you feel?\n\nParticipant: I think it made me feel like a genius. It was a hard game, and I liked it for that. I liked how I had to use my brain to get through the game. I liked the puzzles and the enemies. It was just a very satisfying game for me.\n\nResearcher: Did the game have a story? If yes, what was it about?\n\nParticipant: I can't remember exactly.

Could it be seen as a piece of art?\n\nParticipant: I think it was the music that got me thinking about that. It sounded like nothing else I had heard before.

One that sticks out in my mind is a game that I played on my Macbook. It was a game that was free to play, although I never played it online. It was called "The Company of Myself". It\'s hard to describe exactly why I thought it was art. I just remember feeling a sense of wonder when I started it up and a sense of dread when I was playing it. I didn\'t like the art style, per se. The graphics were pixelated and, at times, they were just colored rectangles. But there was something about the game that made me keep coming back to it. I\'m not sure if it was the atmosphere, the music, the gameplay, or the story. I believe the game was about the main character, who was some kind of blob, trying to get bigger and you had to do something in order to get bigger. I don\'t remember what. I think the game was supposed to be some sort of commentary on games and how they are made and who makes them. I don\'t know why I thought that, but that is what I got from the game. I remember that the game was getting harder and harder as I kept playing it. There were no checkpoints and you couldn\'t get any more lives. You had to start all the way over if you died. I think there was a part in the game where I had to jump across a series of platforms and if I didn\'t make it, I would die. I kept trying and trying to get it right. I had to get it right. I died so many times, but I didn\'t give up. The game was getting harder and harder, but I had to keep going. Finally, after what seemed like hours, I made it across all the platforms. I was so happy that I beat it. I was breathing heavily and I felt like I had accomplished something. It felt good. It felt right.

It is like a painting: some are art and some aren\'t. I think that some games are really artful and that there are others that are less artful. I think that some games are really beautiful and that there are others that are less beautiful.\n\nResearcher: What do you think of the term "art" when applied to digital games?\n\nParticipant: It is a very hard question.

I was able to think about myself, about the world, about life and death, and about everything that I could not think about in the first place. I was able to think about the meaning of my existence. I remember when I came back to reality, I felt like a new person. I was fascinated by my own existence and by the concept of existence in general. I had never felt this way before.

When I was playing the game, I was immersed in a totally new world. I was in Rapture, and I was not thinking about my problems. I was thinking about what I was seeing in the game. It was like what the point of view of the game was. It was so deep, and I could understand the characters in the game. I could understand the story in the game and the story of the world. For the first time, I thought that I was immersed in a movie; I could think about many things that I could not think about before.\n\nResearcher: Please describe in detail what made you consider this game experience as art.\n\nParticipant: I could think about the meaning of my existence.

The first one was in a game called Journey. It was pretty early in the morning, and I was playing alone. I had only played for about 10 minutes when I realized that I was playing something that was truly different. The game is a very simple platformer, but the environment is so beautiful that it was more like an experience than a game. The second experience was in a game called Inside. It was a game about a boy who had to escape from a factory. It is very dark, and at the end, there is a scene where you see the boy standing on a platform, and he falls. What made me consider it as "art" was that the whole game is focused on the boy trying to escape, and you know that he can\'t. But at the end, you realize that the boy is just an object, and that he was only used to tell a bigger story about the world, and the world that the boy wanted to escape was this factory. It\'s a very dark game, but maybe it\'s not so dark, because the boy is not the one who is doing bad things, but he is just trying to survive.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your detailed report. Is there anything you would like to add?\n\nParticipant: I did not really understand your question, but I will try to answer it. I believe that a game can be an art as long as the creator is trying his or her best to tell a story or to make something that is unique. I think that when people create things, their goal is to be different. If your goal is to be different, you are creating something special.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time.')

I get immersed in the game so much that I forget everything around me. I can feel the pain, fear, joy, and the sadness in the game. The games that have had this effect on me are Crysis, Crysis Warhead, and Crysis 2. These games are graphically so beautiful that I sometimes get lost in the world. I feel like I am actually there.\n\nResearcher: Do you think that digital game experiences that are experienced as art are necessarily different from other game experiences?\n\nParticipant: Yes, definitely. They are more realistic, and I feel like I am actually there. That is why I think that they are art.\n\nResearcher: What about the perception of digital games as art do you think is special?\n\nParticipant: I think that the perception of digital games as art is special because it is a visual experience.

It is a turn-based RPG, with some strategy elements. It\'s art in its simplicity. It doesn\'t have to have a lot of things in it to be art. It\'s the story, the setting, the music, the little details that make it art. I could easily see a story like this being a novel, but the fact that it\'s a video game just makes it more amazing.\n\nI think that video games have the potential to be more art than any other medium. With novels, it\'s very easy to fall into the trap of telling people what to think. With games, you\'re more of a spectator. You get to feel like you\'re part of the story.\n\nResearcher: What makes this game experience as art?\n\nParticipant: It\'s the story. The music. The setting. It was very immersive. The characters and how they interacted with each other. The story was a bit dark, so it was interesting to see how people reacted to it. I am generally not a fan of games that are dark, but this one was different. It was just dark enough to be interesting, but not too dark to be scary.\n\nResearcher: What makes this game experience as art in your opinion?\n\nParticipant: I think it was just the way that it was told. It was told as a story, not just as a video game. It was set up like a book, with the story being told over a series of chapters. It had the look and feel of a book.\n\nResearcher: How was this experience different from other game experiences you had?\n\nParticipant: It was a lot slower. There were a lot of characters to remember. The art style was different. The characters and art are very simple, but it\'s not just simplistic. It\'s a good balance.\n\nResearcher: How was this experience similar to other game experiences you had?\n\nParticipant: It was an RPG. That\'s what most of my gaming experience has been.

I tried to include different kinds of games in the spectrum of "art" in order to get a better understanding of how different kinds of games can be perceived as art.\n\nI used different methods of playing and watching to get a better understanding of the experience of the participants. I asked them to tell me about their experience, what was happening in the game, what their experience was like, and what they thought about the game. I asked them to write down the experience in a textual form and to draw or write about it. I asked them to play the game again and tell me about the experience. I also asked them to bring the game with them and to play it with me.\n\nThe memories they have about the experience can be organized in different ways, so I ask them to bring the game to the interview, and I ask them to write about the experience. I also ask them to draw or write about it. Finally, I ask them to play it with me or watch me play it with them.\n\nResult\n\nThe experience of playing a game can be summarized in various ways.

I had already played it before, but I was playing it again for school. I was taking this class where we had to play a game and write a paper about it. I chose Portal because I knew the game and I was interested in playing it again. I played the game in about a week, but I had to work on it when I had time. I played it on and off. I would go for about an hour, and then I would play another game for an hour or two. I am someone who has a lot of energy, so I didn't want to spend my whole time on a game.

I was totally immersed in the game. The aesthetics of the game, the music, the sound effects, the graphics, the camera angles. It was all so beautiful. There were so many things going on in that game and I was hardly able to follow the story. It was so confusing! I was scared, frustrated and had no idea where to go but I loved it. It was like nothing I\'ve ever experienced before. This game made me feel so many things. I was so into the game and I was so anxious to know what was going to happen next. It\'s like I was right there in that room with the main character. I just loved it. I think that this game makes me feel so many things because of the way everything was put together. The way the game is presented, the way the music is used, the camera angles. I think this game makes me feel the way I do because the creators of that game knew so well what they were doing. They knew why they were doing certain things and that is what made the game so unique to me. I really enjoyed this game and I still have it in my pc.

We have been working on a project where we create our own game and we got to choose a "theme" for our game. I chose art as my theme.\n\nI brought to mind a game that I experienced last year in the same program. In that experience, the game was called "The Canyons" and it was a game where you had to find your way out of a canyon. It was created by a group of students and they had a look into that kind of art where it was all about the experience.\n\nYou were supposed to walk through the canyon, and there were lots of rocks and trees and stuff, and you could look at it. When you walked up to a rock, you could hear its sound, and you could also hear your own sound, like your footsteps and stuff like that. It was a very good experience and I didn\'t think about it as art in that moment, but when I look back at it, I think: Wow, this was art.\n\nResearcher: How would you describe what you felt and thought during that experience?\n\nParticipant: I was in a dark room, and it was quite scary, because I couldn\'t see anything except for the rocks and trees in front of me. I was just walking through the canyon, and I could hear my footsteps and the sound of the water. It\'s like an art game, it\'s supposed to be that way, but it was very scary.\n\nResearcher: How did you feel about the game that you experienced as art?\n\nParticipant: I thought it was really cool.

I'm thinking of them as objects, like sculptures, paintings, books. Maybe even physical objects. I'm thinking of them as objects of art because they have some features that are art. They have originality, they try to be meaningful and have a message. They're crafted with care and with love. They have artistic value. They're interesting to look at and they're interesting to think about. They're also important. People spend a lot of time making them and playing them. People do things for the sake of the enjoyment these games bring them. They're also some kind of art because they can make you feel something and can make you think. They can touch your heart, make you cry, make you feel better, make you feel bad. They can make you think about things. They can make you connect with others. They can make you connect with yourself.

I think the first time I ever did was in a game called "The Stanley Parable". It was an experimental game. It was a game that made me think about the way that I play games, and it was a game that had a lot of humor to it. In the game, you play as Stanley, and you are in his office. It is the day of his termination from his job. He has a choice to make. He can either quit, or he can stay. The goal of the game is to choose what Stanley wants to do. He has a conversation with a narrator that is supposed to guide him through his options. The narrator tries to get Stanley to stay, but Stanley chooses to quit. He quits his job because he doesn\'t want to work for a company that doesn\'t care about him. Then the narrator tells him that he has done a good job, and that he can leave. Stanley walks out of his office with a happy ending. After the game is over, you can play it again. When it starts, Stanley is in his office. The narrator tells him to make a choice. Stanley now has a choice to make. He can either walk out of the door, or he can quit. This time, he chooses to walk out of the door, and the narrator tells him that he has made a bad choice. Then, the narrator tells the player that they have made a bad choice. This is very interesting to me. It makes me think about the way that I play games.

I didn't know what to expect from the game. I played it to pass time. When I started playing, the game was very abstract and eerie. It was very dark in the game, and it made me feel alone in the game. The visuals were very dark and unclear, and I couldn't make much of the environment. What helped me to understand the environmental elements was the story. The narrator was talking about a man who was in a car crash and was sent to a remote island to heal. As the game progressed, I was able to walk around the island and explore the environment. I was also able to find out more about the car crash through the letters and diary entries from the main character in the game. I found the game very emotional. It was a very moving experience, and it made me appreciate the beauty of the environment and the story. I've never experienced a game like Dear Esther. The visuals and the story combined together made the experience more memorable. I can remember the game very well. I can remember the dark visuals, the stories, the environment, and the emotions that I felt while playing the game.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time.\n\nParticipant: You're welcome!\n\nOur data has been collected and we can now start our analysis.

In this way, we were able to create a narrative that showed the varying experiences of our participants with games as art. The dataset also included information such as participant age, gender, country, and the type of game they experienced as art.\n\nIn order to better understand our participants' experiences with games as art, we created categories based on the themes that emerged in the narratives. These categories included:\n\nInteractive component\n\nVisions of reality\n\nEmotions\n\nImmersion\n\nChallenges\n\nValue\n\nInteractivity\n\nInteractivity is the core characteristic of games, and we found that all of our participants' experiences with games as art involved")

She was a very nice person and she made me think about my life.

It seems that art can be used as a label or category to describe almost any experience in a game. Sometimes, it is the whole game that is referred to as art. Other times, it is only a certain part in the game that is called art. Sometimes, players may also experience an art museum in the same way that they experience a game. This interview can be used to understand why people experience games as art.\n\nAs the interview shows, in some cases it is the story or the setting that is referred to as art. Players feel moved by the story, and the game is then described as art. In other cases, the game is referred to as art because of the way it makes the player feel. The player may feel')

I have no idea. Nor do I care. I am not an artist or a creator of art. So I am not sure if I can answer this question, but I will try.\n\nI think my experience was not an art experience, but it was something else.\n\nLet me see, how should I start?\n\nI guess I could give an example: I remember when I first played Portal. I had never played a game like that before. It was a first person game, but the player character was able to move between two worlds, one of them, the regular world, the world you are used to, and the other world, full of puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles were in the second world. The player had to use the portal gun to move between the two worlds and shoot two portals. Then the player had to find objects in the first world and move them to the second world, and then move between the two worlds to solve the puzzle.\n\nThe player had no weapons or anything. Just the portal gun.\n\nI played it many times, I was fascinated by it. The game was so different from any other game I had ever played before, and it was also much harder than any other game I ever played before. I tried to beat the game. I never did. I still cannot beat it.\n\nI have never played another game like that. The only other game I have played that was like that is Portal 2, and it was not the same. The story was different. The environment was different. The puzzles were different. It was not the same game as the original Portal.\n\nBut I loved Portal. I played it over and over again.\n\nI never understood the story. I never understood the puzzles. I still do not understand either of them, and I do not care.\n\nI remember, I played it with a friend of mine after school. We talked about it for hours. We had conversations about it, we laughed about it, we tried to understand it. I never did.\n\nWe created our own theories about it. We tried to find the answers. We never did.\n\nI loved the game. I remember I used to play it when I was very tired. When I was so tired I could not even think anymore. I would sit in front of the computer')

For example, Journey, Flower and Ico.\n\nResearcher: Please tell us about the experience you described above in more detail.\n\nParticipant: In Journey you are never given a name or a backstory. You only know that you are a little person walking across a vast desert. The only words you hear are: "Hello. Where are you going?" You can only answer with a musical tone.

I felt the loneliness that the character must have felt as well.\n\nResearcher: What do you think is essential for experiencing a digital game as art?\n\nParticipant: I think that if the game makes you feel something, then it is art.

This world has become so advanced in the technological field that it has come to the point when the people of this world do not even understand the technology the world is based on. The game is set in this world and the player is in the role of the Last Castoff, whose mind was thrown into the body of a new host each time the player died. There are many kinds of castoffs in the game and the player can choose which castoff to play. The player can also customize the castoff to his or her liking.

The player is also given a choice of which of the three classes (Glaive, Nano, Jack) he or she wants to play.

The study is based on a survey of 22 participants who considered video games as art.\n\nIn order to delineate the concept of art, the research divides art into three categories:\n\nFine art (painting, sculpture)\n\nDesign art (architecture, graphic design)\n\nCultural art (literature, music, theater, film)\n\nVideo games are a cross over between cultural art and design art. They are a new medium that combines both of the other types of art. Video games can provide many different cultural art experiences. It can also bring new forms of design art to the table.\n\nVideo games fit into the definition of art as a cultural practice. It is something that is repeated again and again by the members of a society. It is something that can be taught and learned. It can be spread from person to person.\n\nVideo games can be seen as a form of game play. This definition of art is connected to the concept of play. The meaning of play is very similar to that of game play. The main difference is that play is a more general term, while game play is a subtype of play.\n\nArt is not just one thing, it is a practice. It is something that gets used again and again. Art is something that is made and re-made. It is something that gets spread from person to person.\n\nArt is something that brings up certain feelings or emotions in an individual. Art can cause an individual to feel a certain way.\n\nArt is also an object or product that is made by one or more people. Art is something that is created by humans.\n\nThe following are some art works that are mentioned in the study:\n\nThe Art of Videogames:\n\nResearcher: How do you feel that digital games can be compared to art?\n\nParticipant: I think that they are more similar than different. Both are unique in their own way.\n\nResearcher: How so? How are they similar?\n\nParticipant: They're both forms of expression, and in a way, both are created.\n\nResearcher: Could you elaborate more on this?")

It's something that you feel a lot, something that brings out a lot of emotion. It's something that you just feel like you need to think about and you need to experience. It's something that you can't really explain. It's something that you just feel, and you need to feel.

I would consider that to be an art experience. It's something that I still think about to this day. It's something that really captured my attention. I still think about the game to this day. It's something that I know I'll never forget. It's something that felt like a lot of emotion, a lot of feeling, and a lot of passion. It's something that I felt made me feel a lot of emotion.

I am especially mesmerized by the way the music and art are combined to give me a feeling of tranquility in the face of danger. The music is really important to me as well as the art, and the two always seem to have a certain connection. This connection has a major impact on my feelings and emotions while playing. The art style is one of the main reasons why I love the game so much.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much, we will stop here. Do you have any questions about the interview?\n\nParticipant: No, I think I am good.\n\nResearcher: Great, thank you for your time.\n\nThe interview took about 15 minutes.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAfter transcribing the interview and reading it through, I tried to get a better understanding of why the participant experienced the game as art. I was really interested in the way they described the music and art together. They seemed to have an important connection. They didn't just describe an individual experience, but instead described a series of experiences that have been linked together. So I looked at each of the experiences separately and analyzed it.\n\nThe first experience was about the music. When I listened to the music in isolation, I found that I enjoyed it quite a lot. The music had a nice calming effect on me. As a result, it felt like the player was experiencing something similar. The music is very soothing and can make you feel like the game is taking you on a journey. It makes you feel as if you are traveling somewhere and encourages you to explore the world of the game. This feeling of traveling and exploring is very similar to how the player experiences the game itself. So it is easy to see how the music is connected to the feeling of exploring and traveling. This makes sense because the players are exploring the game world and traveling through the game.\n\nThe second experience was about how the music and art are combined to create a certain feeling. The participant stated that the music and art are connected. I then tried to find out if the music and art are designed to be connected. The music and art do indeed seem to be designed to be connected. I found two things that supported this assumption. One of the things was that the game developers made a video talking about how they designed the music and art to be connected. This is a direct link between the two")

It is a very well designed game, and the environment, the characters, and the music are all artfully done. The game has many different endings and I have not yet seen all of them. The one ending I have experienced is very well done and thought out. In the game, there are many different ways to end it. The ending I experienced is one that I don\'t want to spoil for anyone else who might play the game in the future.\n\nThe ending involves the main character, Adam Jensen, having to kill a human being. Throughout the whole game, Adam is trying to figure out who he is as a human being and what his purpose is. He comes to the conclusion that we are all human beings and we all have the right to live. Throughout the game, he makes it clear that he doesn\'t like the way human beings are treated. In the ending, he takes the life of another human being with his own hands.\n\nResearcher: Tell me more about your experience in detail.\n\nParticipant: I was actually surprised by the ending.

I am not going to tell you which games I have played, because it is not really important for this interview. But I will tell you one thing. One of the first games I ever played, the one that really sparked my interest in gaming, is Super Mario Bros.\n\nIt was my first game, and I played it often. I played it so often that I memorized each level and every course in it. I played it so much that I could play it with my eyes closed. And you know what? I can! I really can! There are still some parts of the game that I do not know by heart, but I know most of it. I know every secret. I know every trick. I know the way to complete every level in the game. I know how to finish the game in the fastest time possible.\n\nAnd when I play it, it is not just for fun. It's not just something to do. It's a piece of art. You see, I have memories from when I was a child. I remember that I used to play it. And I remember the feeling that I got. I remember the sense of accomplishment that I felt when I completed a level. I remember the fear that I felt when I saw a boss, because I knew that I could not defeat it by myself. I remember the sense of power that I felt when I finally took down a boss. I remember the sense of wonder when I saw a new environment. I remember the sense of accomplishment when I finally completed the game.\n\nI remember all of these things, and I remember how they made me feel. It is these memories that make it art. It is these memories that make me feel these emotions, even though I did not feel them when I first played it. It is not the game that makes me feel these emotions, but my memories.

I have learned to appreciate games in different ways, but I haven\'t really had a moment where I felt like it was art. When I played Limbo years ago, I remember feeling like it was art. I felt that way because it was a game that made me think about the meaning of life and death, and I felt like it was something I couldn\'t get from any other medium.\n\nResearcher: What was it about Limbo that made you think this way?\n\nParticipant: I don\'t want to spoil the experience for people who haven\'t played it, but there was one moment in particular that made me think about life in a way that I hadn\'t before.

It was one of the first games I played, so I didn\'t know how to get past certain parts, and I was frustrated. I kept trying to find ways to get past these obstacles, and I eventually did, but I remember feeling like I was exhausted. I was like, "What the hell? Why did I just play this game for three hours?" But then I finished the game and I was like, "Woah, OK, I\'m glad I played this." I guess I didn\'t really understand what I was getting into, but I enjoyed it.\n\nResearcher: Do you think you would have considered Limbo as art if you had not played it for three hours?\n\nParticipant: I don\'t know.

The game I am about to describe is Journey by thatgamecompany, released in 2012. I played the game with my fiancÃ©, and we both had a similar experience. The game is about two things: finding a way to a mountain and experiencing the surrounding environment. In order to reach the mountain, the player has to find hidden passages and pieces of cloth, which are the game\'s "prizes". The cloth is used to make a scarf, which is necessary to progress through the game.\n\nThe game\'s setting is a vast desert, in which the player can explore a vast, open landscape. The environment is filled with sand pillars, caves, and ruins. It is also filled with other players, who are either exploring the environment alone or in groups. At the end of the game, the players meet at the mountain, and the game ends with the players walking towards the mountain and disappearing.\n\nI felt a sense of wonder while playing the game. The gameplay was soothing, and the environment was beautiful. I felt the game\'s setting to be peaceful, despite the countless times my fiancÃ© and I died, which we did a lot. We were exploring, trying to figure out how to reach the mountain. The game had a simple, yet solid story, and I really enjoyed the game\'s setting. The game\'s music gave me a sense of peace and wonder, which I believe is what the game was aiming for. After playing the game, I felt relaxed and a sense of accomplishment. I felt like I had been on an adventure, and in a way, I had been.\n\nResearcher: Great, thank you for your answer!

I felt a connection with the other player and I admired their sense of movement and I noticed how graceful they were in their movements. I was in awe of the beauty of the game and the other player.

The music and the graphics were amazing. It's a story about a boy who lost a loved one and wants to bring him back to life. So to achieve this he needs to kill 16 colossi. His first colossus is really easy to kill. After he defeats the first one, a bigger and more powerful colossus is waiting for him. The most powerful colossus is the last one. After you beat all the colossi, you will have to fight against this one. You have to shoot him with your bow and arrows to kill him. This colossus is really hard to kill.

I played this game many times, and I always had a lot of fun with it. It's a stealth game, and it's also a survival game. I always liked the amazing design of the game, and the story is just perfect (I think that the story in this game is just so much better than in all the other Metal Gear games). It's a very cinematic game, and it's very emotional. It's a very hard game, and it requires a lot of patience. I remember that I was really passionate about this game, and I was very happy to have found a game that I would play very often. I was very surprised by the graphics of this game, because at that time (2004) it was the best looking game that I had ever played. I could say a lot more about this game, but I think that this should be enough to show you what this game means to me.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.\n\nParticipant: You're welcome.\n\nResearcher: What is your age?\n\nParticipant: I'm 27 years old.\n\nResearcher: What is your gender?\n\nParticipant: I'm male.\n\nResearcher: What is your current occupation?\n\nParticipant: I'm a student right now.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much for the interview!\n\nParticipant: You're welcome, and thank you for asking me!\n\nReferences\n\nBogost, I.

I\'ve had experiences in which I considered the game art, but that was not the focus of my enjoyment. In particular I thought that the game Ico was art. The feeling I had in that game, the feeling of the world, of the character, was almost like being in an art movie. The atmosphere, the loneliness, the way the character and the world interacted together was very artistic in my eyes.\n\nResearcher: What did you experience in that game that made you think of it as art?\n\nParticipant: First of all, the graphics were not the best, but the way the character interacted with the world and the way the world interacted with the character really felt like a work of art.\n\nResearcher: Could you be more specific?\n\nParticipant: There was something about the loneliness of the character. It was not just that there were no people in the game, it was that the character seemed so alone. I felt alone when I played that game and I have rarely felt so lonely when playing a game. I felt like I was the only person in the world and that created a feeling of art. Also, the way the character interacted with the world, the way he could move the world. The world felt alive, it felt like a place with a history and with a future. It felt like a real place. I don\'t know if I can explain it in a way that makes sense, but it was a feeling of a world. The world was a character as much as the other characters were.\n\nResearcher: Did you think that a game could be art before you played Ico, or was this experience a surprise to you?\n\nParticipant: I did not think a game could be art. Or I thought that I would not be able to experience art in a game. I did not expect a game to be art.\n\nResearcher: How did you experience the art in this game?\n\nParticipant: I just felt it. I felt that I was experiencing art. I felt this was art.\n\nResearcher: Do you think that your experience of this game as art was influenced by the fact that it was a video game?\n\nParticipant: It was because I had a special experience with the game.

A game that consists of only one player traversing through a vast desert landscape, accompanied only by the music and the player\'s companion flying through the air, looking like a column of sand.\n\nDuring that time, I was reading a lot about the concept of transcendence and how that can be achieved through art and actions. It made me wonder how a video game like Journey (2012) could help me achieve this. I heard that the developer of Journey (2012), Jenova Chen, was inspired by his own life experiences.\n\nThe concept behind Journey (2012) is similar to the ancient Buddhist "Noble Eightfold Path" of life. It consists of the following: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.\n\nI played Journey (2012) in a very quiet room with just my headphones on. The music was incredible. It made me feel like I was on a spiritual journey. The game experience did not just consist of the music but also how my actions affected the world around me.\n\nI believe that Journey (2012) is a game that does not just transport you to another world but also makes you aware of the world around you and your place in it. I was very aware of my own actions and the consequences they might have had. I had the feeling that I had a certain purpose in the game. I felt connected to the world I was in. I wanted to explore every inch of it. I had a feeling of wonder and exploration that made me feel like a kid again. The feeling of being in another world and being able to interact with it by my own actions felt liberating.\n\nI believe that art is an experience that cannot be explained. Instead, it is a personal experience of the person experiencing it. I believe that art is a tool to experience something different than what you are used to or what you are exposed to. The artist may give you a medium to experience something in a new way or a new perspective.\n\nI believe that Journey (2012) is an art form that can be experienced in a new perspective. It allows you to see things in a different way, to feel things in a different way, to think about things in a')

I remember I was about 12 years old, and my dad had just purchased a new computer. I can still remember the excitement of finally having a computer of my own. I spent my weekends playing games and exploring the internet. I remember one day that I had some free time and I decided to play a game I had recently downloaded. It was a free game, you know, the type of game that is fun but not too challenging or complicated. You can play it and get a fun experience out of it, but it is not something you necessarily have to play.\n\nWhen I started playing the game, I remember noticing the graphics, and how well everything was detailed. I remember being fascinated by the look of the game. I thought that the graphics were so well put together that it looked like a movie, even though I knew that it was a game. I feel like the graphics were a big part of what made me feel like this was a game that was worth playing. I thought that it was a fun game, and I enjoyed playing it, but it was the graphics that made me think of it as something worth experiencing.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much for your detailed description. Is there anything else you would like to add?\n\nParticipant: I guess I would like to add that I have played this same game several times since, and I have never really had the same experience. The graphics are okay, but they are not the same as what I experienced the first time I played the game. I do remember that I have had similar experiences with other games I have played. I have never thought of them as "art" but I have still thought of them as experiences worth having.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much for your answers.

The game was published in 2010, by "Playdead".\n\nI really liked the game, because of the visual style, which was very dark and fascinating. What I also found very interesting was the fact that it appeared to me as if the whole game was just one big puzzle. I normally don\'t like games that just feel like you\'re just solving puzzles. For me it feels like just a waste of time. However, in this game it was different, because the whole game was a puzzle and you had to solve it in order to progress.\n\nI also liked the music, which was very fitting to the style of the game. The music created this feeling of isolation, which was exactly what the game was about.\n\nThe game is about a little boy, who has to get his sister back from the evil creatures that have taken her. The whole game is about the boy\'s struggle.\n\nIt is a nice game, I really liked it.\n\nI also played another game which I experienced as art.\n\nThis game was called "The Stanley Parable". It was published in 2011 and was created by "Galactic Cafe".\n\nThe game is quite funny in my opinion. It is about this guy named Stanley, who works as a clerk in a very big office. The game starts of with him sitting at his desk, doing his work. However, there is a problem. Stanley is actually very unhappy with his job and he is not really doing his work. He just sits there, thinking about all the things his life could be.\n\nThere is a narrator in the game, who is telling Stanley what he should do, but Stanley is ignoring him.\n\nLater in the game, you get to make decisions for Stanley, and these decisions decide how the story will go on.\n\nThe game is very well made, in my opinion. I really enjoyed the different endings, which were of course influenced by the decisions you made.\n\nThe game is also full of humor.

It's the only game that made me really emotional. I have played a lot of games, but the emotional involvement with Journey was something I had never experienced before. It felt so unique. It's a game that has a very simple story, but in the end it's a story of friendship and companionship. That's something that you hardly ever see in video games, and I was really touched. The fact that you are thrown into this experience with a random stranger and you can only communicate through a handful of gestures, really makes you feel like you are making a connection with someone. I think the experience of playing Journey is special because it's a game that's focused on the player having a certain type of experience, and I think that's something that is unique to video games. There is really nothing like it.\n\nResearcher: How was your experience different from playing a non-interactive game and watching a film?\n\nParticipant: I think Journey is a beautiful example of an art game, and I think it's different from a lot of film experiences. It's different because there is interaction. There is a different level of engagement that you have when you are playing a game. A lot of times you are really immersed in the experience. I think it's because you are playing the game, and you are actually part of the experience, that you connect with it more than when you are just watching a film. I think it's also because of the level of control you have in a video game. You have the power to control your character, and in a lot of cases you can decide what to do in a game. This is something that you don't have in a film. Game players have a lot more control than just watching a film in the cinema. I think that's why video games are more immersive and emotional than watching a film.\n\nResearcher: How is the efficacy of experiencing video games as art affected by the player's game play style?\n\nParticipant: I think that the efficacy of experiencing video games as art is affected by the player's game play style. There are multiple ways in which you can experience video games as art. It's not just about the type of game you play. It can also be about the type of player you are, and your approach to video games. I think that my experience of playing Journey")

But I can try.\n\nWhen I first picked up a controller and played the first game of my life I was only 4 years old. My dad had bought a Mega Drive, the 16 bit console from Sega (which was the competitor of Nintendo). I instantly fell in love with video games, of course, and I was playing it every day, or rather every night, because my parents were really strict about playing video games too long and too late. So I kind of had to hide the fact that I played video games, which made it even more special.\n\nI remember one game that I played during my childhood that made a huge impression on me: "Batman Returns" for the Mega Drive.\n\nThe game was amazing, at least for a 4 year-old kid. The music, the colors, the levels, the enemies. It was my first real "adventure" game. It was also the first game that I played that had a so much "life" to it. I was playing it with my friends, and we were just talking about the game, what\'s going to happen next, what kind of gadgets we will get, what we should do in the next level, etc. I was so much in love with the game that I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. I was already anticipating what\'s going to happen next in the next level. I think that it was a game that made me realize how the world of video games is so different than the real world.\n\nI think that it was a game that made me realize how the world of video games is so different than the real world.\n\nAs I got older the games that I played got more "mature" and more special. I played the Silent Hill series. I played the Shadow of the Colossus. Both of them are games that I can remember as art.\n\nThe most recent game that I played that made me think of it as art was "The Last of Us". I had played it with my brother, and once again it was the story, the characters, the ambiance. I was playing it with a friend of mine, and when we were playing the game we were just talking about the game. We were talking about what we were going to do next, how we were going to do it, how we were going to survive. It was so much')

I was playing it for several hours when I was really into the experience. I remember thinking to myself, "Wow, this is really cool. I\'ve never seen anything like it before. I didn\'t know that a game could be like this. This is really well made. I wonder if this was made by a single person?" It was really cool to look at, especially when you\'re exploring the world. It seemed like you could go wherever you wanted, and the world was really big. It seemed like it was a lot bigger than the world in Oblivion. I didn\'t play Oblivion, but I\'ve heard that it\'s a lot smaller. I found it really cool that I could go wherever I wanted, and there were all these different people and places and stuff. You could do a lot of different side quests, like helping people find their way home. I really liked that the game was kind of open-ended. I could play the game as a nice guy, or I could play the game as a really evil guy. I chose to play as a nice guy, because it was more fun to play that way.\n\nResearcher: How did you make the decision to play as a nice guy?\n\nParticipant: You know, I\'m not really sure.

I am not a huge gaming fan. I play a game here and there, but I have never really got into gaming. One day I was surfing the net and came across this game that claimed to be a game that was like nothing I have ever played before. It appealed to me because it claimed to be a game that was not about killing, but about helping others and getting along with others. I decided to buy the game and give it a try. I was amazed at how beautiful the game was. The colors were spectacular and the music was amazing. I felt like I was actually in the game. I liked the way that the game moved me to help others and to be a good person. It was really refreshing to play a game that was not about killing everyone. I have been playing it a lot and I am so glad that I decided to try it. The only thing that I don't like about the game is that it is kind of short and I wish there was more to the game. I know that is what the devs said they were going for, but it is still kind of a bummer that it is so short.\n\nResearcher: Did you consider this experience as art at the time? If so, how did you experience that?\n\nParticipant: Yes. I experienced it as art at the time. I think because I was able to feel something while playing the game. I was able to feel like I was actually in the game. I felt like I was actually helping someone and it was good to feel that way.\n\nResearcher: What do you think of this experience now?\n\nParticipant: I think it is art now. I think it is art because of the way I was able to feel while playing the game. I played the game and I felt like I was actually there with the other person helping them. I felt like I was actually helping other people at the time and I felt good while doing it. I don't think I have ever felt that way while playing a game before.

In The Last of Us, there is a particularly unsettling area where you enter an abandoned mall. It's the kind of place that has been taken over by nature and a feeling of dread. You see the aftermath of a brutal struggle between humans and infected. You see infected bodies, bloody hand prints on the walls, and blood on the elevator. The music is haunting and there are unsettling sounds coming from the area. It was a very powerful scene.\n\nResearcher: Can you tell me more about what made this experience so powerful?\n\nParticipant: Well, the environment was extremely detailed making the place look like a war zone. The sound design was spot on. You hear the birds chirping and the wind blowing, but you also hear the infected walking around in the distance. The music was extremely well done and perfectly fit the setting.\n\nResearcher: Do you think this experience is art?\n\nParticipant: I do.\n\nResearcher: Why?\n\nParticipant: Well, it was a combination of how the game was designed (including the sound, graphics, music, etc.) but also the actual experience. The game made me feel uneasy at that moment. It created a feeling in me that I had never felt before, and I think this moment can be considered art. It was a unique experience, and I feel that it's something that video games can do that no other medium can.\n\nResearcher: Why do you say that?\n\nParticipant: Well, it was a combination of the sound, music, graphics, and the overall environment. I felt uneasy and scared. It was a unique experience that I think only a video game can create.

These experiences are not frequent, but they provide great meaning for me.\n\nI was in my first year of university and I was playing a game called Journey. I don't remember the exact details of the story, but I do recall the feelings I experienced while playing the game.\n\nI was playing a character that was trying to reach some sort of mountain. I was in a desert and I had to go through a large door in order to progress. When I stepped through the door, I saw a mountain that was covered in snow. It was a beautiful sight. I remember thinking that it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.\n\nAs I continued to climb the mountain I noticed that there were some other players walking along with me. I was enjoying my experience, but the other players and I started to take damage from the environment. This was a really emotional experience for me. The game was telling me that we were running out of time to reach our destination, but it was also telling me that I am doing this with other players. I was sharing this experience with complete strangers. I was starting to feel really sad because I was running out of time.\n\nI continued to climb the mountain and I noticed that I was starting to run out of breath. I kept on walking and I started to lose health. Eventually, I died and I had to start over again. I was really sad when this happened. I was happy that I was able to experience this once, but I was sad that I did not get to finish it. This is probably the most memorable game experience I have ever had. I felt like I was a part of the experience. I still think about it, and it has made me appreciate art in a different way.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for the interview!\n\nThis is the research project that I am working on for my bachelor's degree.

It did not feel like a game that was made to entertain people. It was made to be art.\n\nResearcher: How was it different from other games?\n\nParticipant: It was not fun to play, and it had no goal. It wasn't about the player playing the game. It was about the game being a game. It was about the game being art.\n\nResearcher: How was it different from other games that you have played?\n\nParticipant: The game was not fun. It was not really a game.

It was the end of a long and, perhaps, "unreal" experience. To be honest, I didn\'t know what to do with myself. I didn\'t know what I wanted to do next. I felt empty and I think that feeling was because I had invested a lot into this game. It was an experience that I shared with friends and it was an experience that I deeply cared about. It was like a good book ending and I didn\'t know what to do with myself. I remember thinking "what do I do after this?" and "how can I keep this feeling going?"

It was a game that changed the way games are made and the way games are perceived. I remember that it was one of the first games I had played that made me think about how I was playing the game. I think a lot of people who have played this game will say that it makes you think about how you play video games.\n\nResearcher: Can you describe this experience?\n\nParticipant: For me, it was a journey that I was taking for the first time. I was playing this game with friends and I remember that I made a lot of mistakes. I remember that I died a lot. I remember that I felt like I was learning something that I would never forget. I remember that I felt like I had been changed as a person. I remember that I felt like I was learning something that I could take with me.

I could be very specific to a game, but I also feel like this is a more general sentiment that I've felt many times, so I don't want to be too specific.\n\nResearcher: Please specify the kind of art you feel games are.\n\nParticipant: I am not sure how to answer this without being overly specific, but I would describe it as artistic and moving. A lot of the time it feels more like a book or a film than a game. Maybe it is the way that the story and the game play are intertwined, or maybe the way that I can relate to the characters or feel immersed in the story and setting. I guess I am trying to explain how I feel when I play a game that has a particularly good story and character development. I feel like there is a level of immersion that I just don't get from other things.\n\nResearcher: Can you think of a specific example for this?\n\nParticipant: I don't really have any specific examples, but I feel like it has happened many times to me. I think it is really hard to explain.\n\nResearcher: Can you think of any examples, even if you feel they are not very specific?\n\nParticipant: The first thing that comes to mind is the Mass Effect series. Not necessarily because I consider it to be art, but because it is a game that I've played recently that has elements that I think of as artistic. The story is a very central part of the game. It is a long series, so there is a lot of backstory and character development over the course of the series. I think I just got really invested into the story and the characters and the whole universe. The story is complex and the game play is fairly straight forward, but I think that by the end of the series, I was feeling really attached to the characters and the universe and the whole story. I think that is what made me feel like the game was art. I had a very strong emotional reaction to the story and the characters. I was invested in the story and the characters.\n\nResearcher: Do you think this made the game more like a book or a film?\n\nParticipant: Yeah, I guess so.

I started walking towards the mountain and after a while I started seeing other people. All of us had scarves. We started moving towards the mountain, which we could see was getting bigger. We were heading towards it because we wanted to get to the top. It felt like we were accomplishing something.\n\nWe kept walking towards the mountain and after a while we started seeing yellow, red, and orange lines on the ground. We could interact with these lines. We started walking on them and the lines took us to places we didn't know. We started walking in one direction, but then we were told to go to another place. It was all very mysterious.\n\nThen I saw a giant robot. I realized it was a mountain. We were walking towards a mountain the whole time! It was a beautiful experience.

There is no fighting or solving puzzles. I think what makes it art, is the environment. When you walk around and read the notes, you feel like you are in the house.

I guess I should say I've been playing computer and video games for a long time, and I think I can say I have an understanding of the medium. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do enjoy playing games from time to time. In terms of art, though, I'm still a little hesitant to call video games art. There is a big difference between what I experience when I am playing a game and what I experience during other art forms such as movies, paintings, or music. I guess I would say that the reasons I have for calling games art are similar to the reasons some people would call movies art. I think when people call a movie art, they say it has a well-crafted plot, interesting characters, and a good soundtrack. These are all things I could say about games too.\n\nResearcher: What makes you call a game art?\n\nParticipant: I guess I could say that there are a lot of things I consider to be unique to games. The way they are designed really affects how I play them. The way I play a game affects how I experience the game. That's why there are a lot of different ways I can play a game and have a different experience. It also means I can play a game more than once and have a different experience from the first time. That's something I couldn't do with a movie, for example.\n\nResearcher: How does this influence your experience of games as art?\n\nParticipant: Well, I think that because of this, games are made with a particular way of playing in mind. I don't think a movie is necessarily made with a certain way to be watched in mind. That's why I say games are made for a player to experience, not a viewer. I think that's really important.\n\nResearcher: Why is it important to you?\n\nParticipant: Well, I think that games are designed so that the player has agency. The player can decide how to approach the game and how to interact with it. The difference between a movie and a game is that you are part of the game. You are interacting with it. I think this is a really important difference, and it's also something I really like. I can't choose how to watch a movie. I can't talk to the characters or make them do what I want.

This is because I have experienced this game in a very personal way. It is a very emotional experience and I feel that I have experienced something that a lot of people will never experience. I will never experience this kind of emotional connection with a violent or casual game. I have also learned something about myself through this experience.

The story of the game is very simple, and the graphics aren't that spectacular, but the game is still very engaging. Especially the first level, where the game gives you the very basic idea of how to play, but leaves you to figure out the rest of the puzzles on your own. It is a game that is incredibly easy to pick up, but also incredibly hard to master. I think what makes this game an example of art is the story it tells. The game starts with a narrator talking about Thomas, a rectangle, who is the main character of the game. He has no friends because he is a rectangle, and no one likes to play with rectangles. This, I think, is the perfect example of the game working with its minimalist graphics, and making a fine story.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for sharing that experience. Now, please tell us about your background. What did you experience video games before the experience you just shared with us?\n\nParticipant: I am a gamer. I have been playing video games since I was a little kid, and I still play them regularly. I used to play a lot of single player games, but nowadays I mostly play multiplayer games. I don't play a lot of games for which I have to pay money, but I do have a few games that I play regularly. I like to play games with my boyfriend, who is also a gamer, and we both play a lot of Minecraft together. He has also played a lot of Thomas Was Alone with me, so I know he thinks the game is a good piece of art.\n\nResearcher: Have you ever played Thomas Was Alone before?\n\nParticipant: I have played it twice, but both times it was a multiplayer game with my boyfriend. I played it with him because I knew he wanted to play it.\n\nResearcher: Do you feel like you enjoyed the game more or less because of the multiplayer experience?\n\nParticipant: I felt like I enjoyed the game more because of the multiplayer experience.\n\nResearcher: Please describe the experience for us.\n\nParticipant: The way we played the game was that we tried to play different characters throughout the game, and we talked a lot about the different characters. We wanted to figure out what kind of person each character would be, and how they would interact with other characters. It was a lot of fun to play the game with")

The story is told by the game itself. The game is about survival. You fight human enemies and infected ones. You have to scavenge for food and ammunition, and you have to make decisions that weigh the lives of other people against the lives of the ones who are with you. At one point in the game, you have to decide for yourself whether you kill an innocent man in front of his son or let them both live.\n\nResearcher: How did you feel at this point of the game?\n\nParticipant: This decision seemed very hard to make. At first, I thought I would let them both live. But I wasn\'t sure if I could make it without the man. And it seemed wrong to kill an innocent man in front of his son. So I killed the man, even though it felt very wrong. I felt very bad about it afterwards. I think it was the most difficult choice I ever made in a game.\n\nResearcher: Why did you consider this experience as art?\n\nParticipant: I considered it art because it touched me deeply. It made me feel the same emotions that a book or a movie would make me feel. I was emotionally invested in the story and I felt the same fear, sadness and anger as the main character. I felt the same moral dilemmas as he did.\n\nResearcher: Would you say that this experience has had an impact on your life as well?\n\nParticipant: Yes.

It was very impressive to see the film projected on the big screen, it was beautiful and the sound was amazing in the dark environment of the room.

The game is about exploration and finding the light. This game was one of the most beautiful things I have ever played.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your answer. Can you please tell me in what way Journey was an artwork?\n\nParticipant: I think this game was an artwork because of the way it affected me. It made me think of the meaning of life. It made me reflect on my own life and it made me question existence.\n\nResearcher: What did the game do to bring up these thoughts and feelings in you?\n\nParticipant: I think the game affected me so much because I was in a dark place in my life at that time.

It was a short, two-hour game that was released for free on Steam. It was a very small game with no dialog, so I think that\'s what made it art. I think that it was art because it made me feel something. I cried when I played it. It was about a boy and a bird, and the boy was deaf, so I think that this made me feel something special about how the boy felt. He felt alone and sad. You could tell by how the boy looked at the bird that he thought it was beautiful. I think that it was about coming of age and love. I don\'t know, maybe that\'s just what I took out of it. It\'s hard to explain. But I think that the art style was beautiful.

When you think of the word "art" (or any word you associate with the notion of art) what comes to mind?\n\nParticipant: Well, I think that art is something that you experience. It\'s a feeling that you get from what you see or do or feel. I think that when some people think of art, they think of this really pretty painting that has a lot of detail and is very expensive. But I think that art is something that you experience. It\'s something that makes you feel something. And I feel sad when I think of this game, so I think that it was an art experience.\n\nThe following is a short interview about the art of games:\n\nResearcher: Would you consider this game to be art?\n\nParticipant: Yes\n\nResearcher: Why?\n\nParticipant: Um, well, it was pretty.

The game itself is very simple, it\'s a platformer, and as you reach the higher levels you feel as if you are growing as a person. You start off in this vast desert, but as you climb the mountains and reach higher levels in the game, you see more wonderful sites. You feel as if you\'re in a great journey. You see beautiful mountains, and lush green grass, and at the top of the mountain, you see the sun. It is a beautiful sight to behold. The music is wonderful as well, it\'s this soft and peaceful music, and it just makes you feel good. You can see that it\'s not a game with a story, it\'s not a game with much puzzle or challenge, but the whole thing just makes you feel good, and at the end of the game, you feel as if you accomplished a goal, and you feel as if you have grown as a person.

It reminded me of an old-school 2D game like "Metroid", however there were a lot of new elements and new gameplay mechanics. For example, I could collect stones from the ground and use them to build a shelter. I could also jump into a "realm" in which I would play as a kid, and I could control the kid with the same commands as I controlled the main character in the main world. At one point in the game, I was fighting a boss, and I had to go into a realm to find the right weapon. The game has an awesome soundtrack, and the narration was great. I loved the writing, and the characters were believable and made me care about them. I was rooting for them, and I wanted them to succeed. I felt a lot of emotion while playing this game.\n\nResearcher: Is there anything else you would like to add?\n\nParticipant: To me, this game didn\'t feel like a game.

It was an action-adventure game, set in a post-apocalyptic world. The game had a beautiful and melancholic atmosphere, it was filled with symbols and metaphors. I was playing the game with my friend, we were both already fans of the genre, and we were both deeply touched by this game for different reasons.\n\nI can\'t remember the plot anymore, but I remember that I loved the idea that the main characters were not without flaws. Just like any human, they made mistakes, they had to face their fears and fight to survive. But in the end, they were not the only ones fighting for survival. They had to protect each other, they had to fight for each other, they had to sacrifice their well-being for each other. The game was about fighting for something more meaningful than just your own survival.\n\nResearcher: You mentioned a game that you played with a friend. How does the experience of this game differ if you play it with other people?\n\nParticipant: I think that this game was so powerful because of the symbolism and metaphors that I mentioned before. The game was about surviving life, and survival is a topic that touches me deeply. That\'s why the game was so meaningful for me. I think that the game was even more meaningful for me because I played it with my friend, we were sharing our feelings about the game and our different interpretations of it.\n\nResearcher: Do you think that the experience of art always concerns some social context?\n\nParticipant: Yes, I think so. If you look at films or novels, you can see scenes that would be meaningless if you were watching or reading the story on your own. In a film, you are experiencing the scenes with other people, and the same is true for a book.\n\nAlthough I read books on my own, I\'m always thinking about the plot, about the characters, about how the setting affects the story. If you read a book by yourself, you might not even see some symbols and metaphors. But if you read the book with someone else, you can share your feelings and interpretations. You can bring in different contexts and discuss them.\n\nResearcher: I see.

You almost never see the other player, and if you do, you don't talk. You are alone in this game, and the experience of being alone in the desert with the sandstorm is very powerful. The music is also wonderful and creates a feeling of being in this game.\n\nResearcher: What is your background?\n\nParticipant: I have experience with several video games. My main background is with online gaming. I am a big fan of indie games and I am often on indie game websites. I have played Journey with my partner one evening and we had a very nice time.\n\nResearcher: What games have you experienced as art?\n\nParticipant: I think Journey is a good example, but also many other games from the indie scene. I am also a big fan of Fez, and I think that is a game that is also close to art.\n\nResearcher: What is your opinion on the relation between the medium video games and art?\n\nParticipant: I think that games can be art if the game is made from the heart. Games are often made to be commercial hits, but I think that if you make a game from the heart, it can be art. I think that the indie scene is a good example of this, where developers make games from the heart and they are often very good. I think that Journey is a perfect example of this, where the game is made from the heart, and the result is a game that is really beautiful.")

It was not directed at a story, but rather the feeling it evokes. It's a game about traveling, losing yourself, about finding yourself in other people, and about the feeling of freedom. It's a game about the feeling of being a stranger and finding a home in the world. It's also a game about the feeling of sadness and loneliness, and ultimately the feeling of being at peace with these things.

You're not bound to the quest of the game, you're on your own journey. You can go anywhere you want, and that's what I felt when I played it. I was free to go anywhere I wanted, and could take my time to enjoy the scenery. I felt like I was on my own journey, and I didn't have to take any quest, or do anything I didn't want to. I could just be.\n\nResearcher: Can you tell us more about the freedom you experienced?\n\nParticipant: It's the feeling of not being controlled by anything or anyone.

You can even go out of the game if you want, and when you want, you're in control.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time. We'd like to let you know")

It\'s a walking simulator that\'s a little hard to describe. It\'s a game where you play as a girl, walking down a forest path with a lantern. You have to walk from your home to the grandmother\'s house, but there are other paths you can take and mysteries you can explore if you choose to. You\'re afraid of something, and you have to choose what to do. I remember that I first played it alone, it was night and I was in the dark, I had my headphones on and turned off all the lights in my room. I just walked down the path, and I started to think about my life, about my goals and fears, and I felt like the girl in the game. It was as if I was actually there, walking the path, thinking about my life. I could feel the atmosphere, the sounds, the graphics, like it was real. The game has a very dark, rough, moody atmosphere, and it really makes you think about what\'s going on. It makes you feel like you\'re the character, and it\'s not just something "fun" that you\'re doing, the game makes you think about your life, and that\'s what art does. I felt like I was really taking a walk down a path in the woods, and that\'s what art does.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for sharing your story with us!\n\nParticipant: You\'re welcome.\n\nI\'m all for video games as art, and this is a great example of how a game can create an experience that can be perceived as artistic. This was brought up in my previous post about how video games can be art, and I think this interview is a great example of why I think that it\'s true. The game is dark, moody and atmospheric, and it makes the player think about their life. This is what art does, it makes you think about your life and your fears, it makes you feel like you\'re walking in the woods, it makes you feel like you\'re the character. It\'s not just a game you\'re playing, it\'s something more, something artistic.\n\nAdvertisements')

The game that was so powerful that it forced me to confront myself. The game that had a narrative that was so disturbing, but also so beautiful. The game that made me question my sanity.\n\nResearcher: Could you please elaborate on what you meant?\n\nParticipant: It was a game that I never finished. It started off about a family on vacation. They were driving in a car, the father, the mother and the child. In the beginning they were on a really bad road, and then suddenly they were in a very dark forest. The mom got out of the car to take a picture of the scenery and then she didn't get in. The father went after her, but he also didn't get back into the car. The child was alone in the car. Eventually the child started to walk, but could not find a way out of the forest. There was a phone in the car that you could use to call someone. You could call someone to tell them that you were lost, but they would not come and save you. There were some other characters in the game, but I can't really remember them. I played this game when I was in high school. I spent a whole summer trying to solve the puzzles and get out of the forest. I never finished it. I couldn't finish it.\n\nResearcher: What made it so powerful?\n\nParticipant: At the time I was a teenager. I was still living with my family. I was not independent, and I felt like I was suffocating. I was also really lonely. The game made me feel like I was trapped in a forest, and I was lost. I was trying to find my way out, but there was no way out. The characters in the game would show up to help me, but I would just ignore them. I knew that they could not help me. I was trying to find a way out, but I just kept getting lost. I was looking for something, but I could not find it. I didn't know what it was, but I knew that I needed it. I also felt like I was very alone. There was something that I was missing, but I didn't know what. I also felt that I was being watched, and that things would happen if I did not find the solution. I felt like I was going crazy. I felt like I had no control over my life. I")

I followed the scarf in the desert and it led me to a gate, so I made my way toward the gate. I pulled the gate open and it was a cave. I walked into the cave and I was greeted by a woman who was singing a song. I looked around and saw a glowing white light. I followed the light and it led me to the top of the mountain. I made my way to the top of the mountain and the woman was there, singing to me. I was in awe of the beauty of the song. I was mesmerized by it. I followed the woman and she led me to the gate.

The game is very abstract, but it also has a stunning visual design and a very compelling narrative. The way you traverse the game world is very smooth and the emotional impact of the game is very intense. It is not only an enjoyable game, but it is also an experience that makes you think. It\'s so different from most other games. Even the weirdest parts of the game make it feel like an experience that is unique and unlike anything else.

He has to find the pieces of her soul and bring them together, but it's hard because the world is being taken over by machines. It's kind of a sad story and I liked the characters, especially one named Popola.\n\nResearcher: Did you play the game on a PC, a console, or a mobile device?\n\nParticipant: I played it on a PC.\n\nResearcher: What was your first impression when you started playing the game?\n\nParticipant: I was really surprised because it was so different from other games I'd played.

It's a very simple game, but a very profound game, it touches me deeper than any other game has, it felt like I was really there, it was a great experience.

There are some supernatural elements in the game, but the overall tone is very dark and sad. And the music is just amazing! I can\'t put into words how much I like the music. The game uses radio and telephone sounds to build the mood and atmosphere. I really like that. I heard a song on the radio the other day that I hadn\'t heard for a long time, and I don\'t even remember why I liked it so much back then. But when I heard it in the game, it triggered that memory.

You are in the woods, you need to find The Mother, and to do that you need to go through the woods. There are paths, and the paths are blocked by barbed wire. You can jump over it or you can go around it. If you jump over it you get a point. And you get a point if you find The Mother. But you can't just find The Mother, you have to find a key in order to get in her house.\n\nThe game is very simple, but it was the first game that I played, that made me feel emotions. It made me feel uncomfortable. And I think that's what art does. It makes you feel something. If you go to a museum and you see a painting, it might make you feel something. It might make you feel something bad, or it might make you feel something good. But it doesn't matter, because it makes you feel something.\n\nI also feel that the The Path is art because of what it makes you feel. It makes you feel the emotions of the character. In this game, you can't die, and your character can't die. It's not about killing your character, it's about finding The Mother. You go through the forest and you get closer to The Mother. And you start feeling that something is wrong. And you know that something is wrong, but you can't find out what's wrong.\n\nAnd it's a very simple game, but it made me feel the same thing as I felt when I was watching films. When I was watching films, I would feel a lot of emotions. It would make me feel something so strong, that I would cry. It would make me feel something that I don't even know what I'm feeling. It was so strong that I wanted to throw up.\n\nAnd I don't know if you have seen the film Memento. I have seen the film a lot of times, I love it.

The whole story is in the form of a diary written by Kaitlin.\n\nThe game was very impressive to me since it was not only well done visually but also in the way the story was told. The game is not about running around and shooting things, it\'s a game about the story of the people living in the house and the people who lived in this house before them. It is a game where you are curious what will happen next and how the story will end. The game was very successful and won many awards, including the "Game Developers Choice Awards â€“ Game of the Year". It was also nominated for a lot of "game of the year" awards in various magazines and websites.\n\nResearcher: Why did it strike you as art?\n\nParticipant: It did not strike me as art right away but after a while I thought about the game and how I felt while playing it. I had never before played a game which was as well written as this one. It was very impressive for me how much effort was put into the story and the way it was told. I think this is an example of a game which could easily be seen as art since the whole experience is not about running around and shooting things. It\'s about the story and how it is told.\n\nResearcher: Did you feel that the experience was enhanced by the game being digital?\n\nParticipant: I think yes, I feel that if this was a movie or a book the experience would not be the same. I think the fact that it was a game made it easier to put yourself in the situation and to feel what the girl felt. In a movie you see the story and you see the characters but you don\'t really feel what they feel. In this game the story was told through cutscenes, letters and notes. You could easily imagine being in the same situation as the girl you play as. You could easily imagine what you would do if you were in her place.\n\nResearcher: Did you feel that the experience was enhanced by the game being a video game?\n\nParticipant: I think the fact that it was a game made')

I remember thinking that this made a great metaphor for relationships in general.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much! That was a very helpful description. Can you think of any other games that you experienced as art?\n\nParticipant: I played a game called Minecraft. I found myself playing that game in a completely different way compared to other games. I would spend hours building a detailed virtual world. I sometimes found myself looking at a sunset that I had created and feeling that the game had become art.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time.\n\nAs you can see, this is not the kind of research that will definitively answer the question whether video games can be art, but it is a good starting point.

Please continue.\n\nParticipant: Journey is a game where you start with a character in a desert. You can go left or right. If you go left you find a dead body on the ground. You walk around it and there is a scarab. The scarab leads you to a mountain that you can climb. At the top of the mountain is a beam of light that you follow. At the end of the light is a mountain and a glowing scarf. When you get the scarf you soar through the air to a town filled with floating rocks. When you land, you can go back and look at the scarf. Then you can take off and fly to an island with a giant tower in the middle. You can go up the tower and there are glowing "scorpions" you can follow to the top. You get there and there is a giant glowing light that you can fly into. You float around in a room of light. You can fly to the ground and there is a white bird that you can follow to a town with a man in a shining robe. You can follow him to a lake. You can jump in the lake and swim to a cave and there is a giant glowing stone that you can swim through. Inside is a glowing orb that you can go around and see yourself. You can fly back out and look at the scarf again. When you look at the scarf, a giant glowing tower appears and you can fly to it. When you get to the top, you can land and look at the scarf. Then you can take off and fly to a giant desert region with a giant rectangular tower in the middle. You can go up to the top and there is a giant glowing beam of light that you can fly into. When you stay in the beam of light for a long time it turns into a giant glowing dragon that you can fly around.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time!

I played this game in 2013, after hearing particularly good things about it. I was actually curious, as I had never played a game like this before. I was hoping that it would be a new experience, which it certainly was.\n\nThis game was a lot like an interactive poem, and I didn\'t expect that. I heard it was a game, but I didn\'t expect to have a game that was basically a poem. I guess I expected something more like Tetris or a racing game.\n\nI really liked the minimalist aspect of the game and the way it allowed me to feel like I was part of the world. It was a very immersive game, and you could feel the poetry in the game. The game took you to the poetry of the world, and it was really well done. It was also a new experience.\n\nI found it to be a unique experience, and I was really amazed and impressed by it. I like the way you interacted with the game and the style of the story it told. It felt like it was a new experience, which is what I was hoping for. It made me feel a lot of different emotions and was just really well done. It was a new experience, and it was the first time I experienced a game like this.\n\nResearcher: Can you tell me more about the experience of playing this game?\n\nParticipant: I feel like I can\'t really describe the experience very well. It was just something that was new and different from the regular video games I played. I played it with a friend, and we talked about how different it was from other games. We were both talking about how it was basically a poem and very different from what we were used to.\n\nResearcher: Please tell me about your friend.\n\nParticipant: He is a lot like me.

I bought this game with my PlayStation 2 when it came out and I played it once. I was really impressed by the game's graphics and the very unusual colossi. At the time, I didn't really know much about art so I was not able to say if the game was art or not but when I played the game I felt like I was experiencing another culture. I felt like I was experiencing how people in ancient Japan may have felt when they discovered the world, and the feeling of being lost in such a new world.\n\nResearcher: Thanks for your detailed response. Please also tell us in how far the game managed to convey these feelings.\n\nParticipant: The graphics and the soundtrack were very impressive. The colossi are also very impressive and the way the protagonist interacts with them reminded me of ancient Japanese stories of gods. I think the game did a very good job of conveying these feelings.\n\nResearcher: Thanks for your contribution. You've mentioned the soundtrack. Did the soundtrack and the sound effects support the experience of the game as art?\n\nParticipant: I think they did. I really liked that the sound effects were realistic and very detailed.

I think of it as a perfect game. It\'s easy to learn, yet hard to master. It\'s simple yet beautiful. It\'s fun to play and it\'s fun to watch someone else play. It\'s a great challenge to get a high score. And it\'s a great feeling when you do. I remember when I first played it and got to level 10. What is interesting about that is that I played it about 20 years ago, yet I still remember the feeling of mastering it like it was yesterday. That is why I think of it as art.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time.\n\nParticipant: You are welcome!\n\n(The interview is concluded and I try to make sense of the dataâ€¦)\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe author of the study of this paper is a researcher at the University of York, England. He interviewed people about their experiences of video games as art and analyzed the responses. He found that the main reasons why participants considered video games as art were based on the aesthetics of the game. The author claims that this is similar to what people experience when they visit a museum, only that this feeling is experienced within an interactive virtual environment.\n\nHowever, I argue that the author\'s approach is flawed because it is based on a narrow definition of what art is. The author does not seem to take into account that within the realm of art, there are many different categories of art, each with their own distinct characteristics. The idea of art is so broad because it is essentially a way for humans to express their feelings, thoughts, and emotions. As such, art can come in many different forms, including music, painting, writing, sculpture, performance, architecture, and dance. Each of these art forms has its own distinct characteristics, and thus, it seems a bit disingenuous to narrow the scope of art down to a specific category. For example, a video game is not the same as a painting, and thus, it would not be possible to compare a video game to a painting based on their respective aesthetics.\n\nAnother problem with this approach is that it is not clear what exactly the author means by "art". Aesthetics is a very abstract concept that is difficult to define. The author does not specify what "art" is, so it is difficult to distinguish what "art" the participants were referring to. It is possible that the participants may have experienced a video game as')

I never had played any game like this before and I didn't know anything about the game except that it looked beautiful.

It was like I was watching a movie and at the same time I was playing it. I was a part of the story and it was like it was happening to me. I was so deeply connected to the game that it was like I had entered a different world. It was so hard to tell where the game ended and I began. After playing it for a few hours I was so moved that I felt like there was a story behind the game and I wanted to know it. So I started to look into it but I couldn't find anything. There was nothing to read about the game, it was just a game. This made me more interested in the game. I was so moved by the game that I wanted to know more about it.

I think it is a great example of a game that can be perceived as art. It is not about the gameplay, but about the experience.\n\nThe Long Dark is a survival simulator in which you play as a character who tries to survive a winter in the Canadian wilderness. To make things more realistic, the game is set in a randomly generated "world" which is not a world at all - it is just a huge map. The game is completely open world and you can explore it as you wish. There is no main story to follow. You can stay at your home base, which is a small cabin that you can build up and fortify to create a shelter for yourself. You can also explore the world around you and help the other survivors that you meet along the way.\n\nThe game is beautiful. It is not focused on graphics, but on atmosphere. There is a day/night cycle and you can see how the weather changes over time. You can also see the snowy mountains in the distance and hear the sound of the wind in the trees. You are listening to the breathing of your character, which is loud and intense. You can hear the animals moving around you. The game is focused on sound and music as well. The sound of the environment is very important. It sounds more realistic than other games.\n\nResearcher: Can you tell me a bit more about the experience?\n\nParticipant: The Long Dark is a game that makes you feel uneasy. It is a survival simulator. You do not play the game for the gameplay, but for the experience. You have to create your own story. If you die, it is on you. You have to take care of yourself. You can\'t just start the game and win. This is what makes the game so different. You are always looking out for your character.\n\nResearcher: What was the most memorable aspect of the experience for you?\n\nParticipant: The most memorable aspect was the feeling of being in the game.

But the controls were so good, the cutscenes were so well made with motion capture, that I really got into the story. The story was about a group of survivors of a great war, who were trying to rebuild their lives. It was all about family, sacrifice and love. The story was so well made, that I actually cried at the end. And the game was only a few hours long. It was an emotional journey for me, I felt like I was there. I felt like I knew the characters and I felt like they were in real life. I felt like the game was no longer a game, but a real movie. I felt like this game was a pure art.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much for your time and effort. If you would like to add something, please do so.\n\nParticipant: To me, Uncharted 4 was the most beautiful game I ever played. It was an experience like no other.

It tells the story of a teenage girl named Max Caulfield who has the ability to rewind time at any point, so that she can go back and try to change whatever she wants about the past. But Max doesn\'t necessarily have to follow the path of least resistance. She doesn\'t have to use her power to avoid dangerous situations. She doesn\'t have to use it to accomplish everything that is possible to accomplish in this world. The game encourages players to use Max\'s ability to rewind time to change their own feelings and thoughts about the world and the actions they are doing, and to contemplate the meaning of their existence.\n\nI can\'t explain why but this game made me think of the human condition, why we are here and what we should do about it. We are born and we die, and nothing in between is guaranteed. It is a miracle that we exist at all, and it is a miracle that we can think about our existence and question what it means to be alive. Some people are not so lucky to be born in a time or place where they can think about these things. So I would like to use my life to understand the meaning of my existence.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time and your effort. Your response was very interesting and detailed.

You can see the passion.\n\nResearcher: Are there any other instances when you experienced a digital game as art?\n\nParticipant: I think that all games are art, but I guess I didn\'t see it that way until I played Journey.\n\nResearcher: Okay, I have a few follow-up questions for you. You said that video games are art, but you are referring to them as art objects. Can you tell me more about this?\n\nParticipant: I guess one example of an art object would be a painting, but a video game is more than just an object, it\'s interactive. And besides, I don\'t know if I believe that all games are art objects.\n\nResearcher: What do you mean by this?\n\nParticipant: If art is supposed to make you feel a certain way, then I still don\'t think all games make me feel that way. For example, I played Call of Duty and that game didn\'t give me any emotional response.\n\nResearcher: I see, but what do you mean by "art object"?\n\nParticipant: You can look at the object and you can see how the artist felt when he made the object.\n\nResearcher: So you are saying that an art object is a physical object that is perceived as art and that can be seen as the result of an artistic process.\n\nParticipant: I guess so.\n\nResearcher: Can you think of any other video game experiences that could be considered art?\n\nParticipant: I don\'t know, I guess it depends on how you see art.

It was just a really pleasant experience, the way that it would change the mood, the art style, the atmosphere.\n\nResearcher: Can you remember what exactly was the art that you experienced? Can you give an example of something that you experienced in this game that you perceived as art?\n\nParticipant: I guess it would be more like the atmosphere. The fact that the game was totally different from everything else. That just makes it art, in my opinion.\n\nResearcher: How did this experience affect you?

It\'s a very nuanced analysis of the place of escapism in art and gaming, and it contains some good advice for dealing with the escapist elements in art and gaming (by which I mean art and gaming that is focused on providing an escape from the everyday). The author is a big fan of escapism in art and games, and sees it as an important part of real, important art:\n\nI want to begin with a caveat about the term "escapism." I don\'t think it deserves the negative connotations it has accrued in the past. We use it to talk about people who watch trashy TV, play video games, or read pulpy books and comics as a way to escape from the "real world" (whatever that means). We use it to describe those who wish to retreat into the comforts of the familiar, to hide from the frightening terrors of the unknown. That\'s a little unfair, I think. Escapism is not the domain of the lazy or the cowardly; it\'s a natural, healthy instinct. If you\'ve ever found yourself in a situation that was just too much to handle, you know what I mean')

The environment is so surreal and alien, and there's no way to communicate with the other people in the game. The music made me feel the same way as I feel when I'm completely alone, and I felt like I was being brought back to the time when I was little, before I had any friends, and I didn't know what was going on with the world. I was a blank slate, and Journey made me feel that way again. I was just another person in the crowd, just like I was when I was little. I was being brought back to the sense of confusion and helplessness I felt when I was little, but at the same time I was being taken out of the world.

You can\'t really "die" in the game, you just have to walk a certain distance. I didn\'t really care about the goal of the game, I just wanted to enjoy the experience. The game doesn\'t really explain anything to you, you just play. There are no cutscenes or anything like that. You just experience the game. The game is very minimalistic, and that was a big part of why I enjoyed it so much. The music is very relaxing, and the game feels very slow. But there is a sense of wonder and curiosity in the game. You have no idea where you are going, but there\'s a sense of excitement. The game has different sections as well. It starts in the desert, and then it transitions into an ice area, and the last area is a temple. I think that was very interesting as well.

At that time I was struggling a lot with my life, and had to move back in with my parents, after living independently for several years. I was very angry and disappointed with my life, and most of all with myself. The game Journey is a spiritual game, and it helped me a lot to get through this rough time. It made me realize that I had to start over, and that it's okay to make mistakes, as long as I learn from them. I started to think of myself as a child of the universe. I played through the game with a friend, and we connected a lot over the game, without ever meeting each other. The game was very calming and beautiful, but not full of action. So I would say that Journey is a very interactive, but passive experience, because you can't really influence the outcome of the game. But I was really touched by it, and in my opinion it is a very well made game.\n\nResearcher: What kind of art could be seen in Journey?\n\nParticipant: I would say that it is an art game. A lot of the other games that are called art games are more interactive than Journey, like Dear Esther (The Chinese Room, 2012) or Proteus (Key & Kanaga, 2013). I would say that Journey is a mix between a video game and a film. The game is basically one long journey through a desert. The music is very good, and it helps to build the atmosphere of the game. And there is a lot of symbolism in the game, like a burning mountain, which represents the journey of life, and how you have to make choices, and how everything will change. The game also has a lot of hidden symbols, which you can find if you explore the game. For example, there are a lot of feathers, which represent the journey of life, and also the journey of the player through the game. Another symbol is a mask, which represents the human face, the player's face.\n\nResearcher: What are the main aspects of the experience that you think are relevant to your experience of Journey as art?\n\nParticipant: For me personally, the main aspect of the game is the music.

I will try to explain why I believe this game to be art. The game is probably best described as a walking simulator. You play as a robed figure and must travel across a desert by walking and occasionally flying. The game is a journey of self-discovery of the character, and of the player as well. The goal of the game is to make it to the end in one piece, and to do that you must discover the landscape and interact with the creatures that live in it. The game is very simple, yet it does so much with what it has. The way it sets you free to explore the world, to discover it and its inhabitants at your own pace, and to do what you feel like, is something I have not experienced in any other game. This freedom, combined with the game's stunning visuals and the soothing ambient soundtrack, makes for an incredibly moving experience. I believe that the game's overall theme is a journey of self-discovery, and you, the player, are the one discovering it. Because of the game's structure and the way it lets you take your own pace, the journey is unique for every player. It is a journey through the desert to a mountain, and a journey through your own mind and memories. It is a journey of discovery of both the world of the game and the player's own self. It is a journey of self-discovery and growth. I think most of the value of the game comes from this unique experience. The game is not a collection of different levels or objectives; you are free to explore the game's world as you choose.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your detailed answer! Before we move on, please take a moment to look over your answer and make sure that it does not contain any words that may be offensive to anyone else. For example, if you mention that the game is beautiful, please replace this with a word that sounds as beautiful but does not have sexual connotations.\n\nParticipant: I will not use the word beautiful, but everything else is fine.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time!")

I first played it a few years ago, and I remember that I experienced a sense of calmness while playing. I was intrigued by the game\'s world, and it\'s mechanics were easy to understand. The game\'s creator, Raphael van Lierop, even said that the game was a "survival sandbox" first and foremost, meaning that it\'s first purpose was to be a sandbox where you can experience the world and play with the mechanics in many different ways. That\'s exactly what I did. I wanted to know how the character reacts when I do this, or that. I wanted to know how the environment reacts to a certain action or a certain combination of actions. I wanted to know how the game reacts to me, and what happens when I do the same thing over and over again. I wanted to explore, to experiment, and to get a feeling for what can be done and what was not possible. I wanted to feel what the world of the game was like, and why it was like that.\n\nPlayer Agency\n\nIf you are reading this it is very likely that you are a video game player. Maybe you remember a time when you played a game and felt that you were in control of the game\'s world. You remember the decisions you made and how they influenced the world around you. This feeling of control is what I call player agency. It is one of the most important concepts to understand when you are interested in video games as art.\n\nIn his book Journey, video game developer Jenova Chen writes about the development of Journey, a game that I consider to be one of the most beautiful experiences I have had in a video game. In the book, Chen talks about the importance of player agency and how it can make a player feel more connected to the game\'s world:\n\n"It feels good to be in control. It\'s the feeling you get when you are driving a car, playing a sport, or flying a plane. It\'s also the feeling you get when you are playing a video game. Player agency refers to the feeling of being in control. When a player is in control of a game, they feel like they have the freedom to express themselves."\n\nGames are different from other media\n\nGames are different from other media such as books, movies, and paintings.

The player has to find the creatures, climb them and then kill them in order to save a young woman.\n\nThe goal of the game is clearly defined, but the player is also allowed to explore the world and reach the sixteen creatures in any order, making his/her own way through the game. The player can also decide to leave the young woman and not save her, or fight the last two creatures instead of the first fourteen.\n\nThe player is the protagonist of the story and has all the freedom he/she wants, but the player is also made aware that he/she has to decide his/her own path - the young woman is depending on it, and there is no right or wrong.\n\nI think that the game succeeds in creating a feeling of awe in the player. It's hard to describe it, but I felt a sense of wonder, since I had never seen something like this before. The player gets to explore a beautiful world and get to know the sixteen creatures.\n\nThe player also gets to feel like a hero, since he/she has to fight and kill the creatures to save the woman.

I can't remember exactly what I was thinking, but I remember this feeling that I was thinking about real life and how to make it better. How to make people better. How to make friends better. I remember thinking about how I can't be there for my friend all the time, but the game showed me different. I got the feeling that I need to be there for my friend all the time and that I can't leave him alone. I don't know, I remember thinking about a lot of things. But I remember that feeling of love. Not the love between two people. I don't know, it was a different love. The love for humanity. The love for my friend. The love for myself.\n\nResearcher: Very good. Thank you for your time.")

I believe the game has a message that I can interpret in many ways.\n\nResearcher: Can you elaborate on your interpretation?\n\nParticipant: The game is about a person who is in the desert, and there are two people. They have a scarf and you don't know who they are and you don't know what's going on, but you want to help one another. You want to connect with the one person who is in the game.

It has been around a long time and I think it's been out for at least four years now. I don't play video games often because they take up a lot of time and I already have a lot of hobbies and things to do. I first heard about Journey in one of the video game magazines my friends buy. The cover story was about this game. They said it was a game like no other. It was a very different game, not your typical game with shooting and killing. It was a game where you play with a person you don't know and you can't communicate with each other. It's not multiplayer in the sense that you play each other in the same game, but you do see each other while you are playing the game. This game doesn't have a story or a goal, it's just about the journey you and the other player make together. You are both on a quest to get to the mountain that is in the middle of the game. You have to work together to get there. You have to help each other to move forward. If you go too fast, the wind will blow you away, so you have to work together to get to the mountain. There is a lot of symbolism in the game. It's about the journey of life and the journey of the people who play the game. The world around you is very symbolic and you can see it through the journey you take. I played the game with the headphones on, and when I was playing it was like I was walking through a snow-covered mountain. You can see the other player in front of you, even though you don't get to see their face. You can see the back of their robes and you can see the scarf on the front. You are both on a journey, and the scarf is the symbol of the journey. The scarf is the beginning of the journey and the end of the journey. When it starts to unravel, it means you are almost at the end of the journey. The scarf is also the end of the journey and the beginning of a new journey. There are also a lot of other things in the game that you can see, but I don't want to spoil the experience for the people who are going to play it. I played this game while sitting on my couch in the evenings. I like to play it when it's just the two of us, and I like to play")

It is considered by many to be a work of art. Ico is a third person adventure game with puzzle elements and platforming. The game is set in a castle and dungeons, the player controls a young boy (Ico) and a mysterious girl (Yorda). The game is meant to be played co-operatively (which I've never done) but the gameplay is very linear, the puzzles are very simple and there are only a few enemies throughout the whole game. The puzzles are there to slow the player down, as the castle is crawling with giants that will crush you if you walk in their line of sight. The player has to lead Yorda through the castle without being seen by the giants, or Yorda will die. The game is very linear, but there is one area where the player has to move a block and a tower to reach the top of the castle, and the player can go back to the bottom of the castle, after reaching the top, the player can't go back to the top, so the player has to move the block and the tower before reaching the top. Ico is a very emotional game, there is no dialogue, everything is shown through the environment and the music. As you can see below, the player is in a cage with Yorda, the giants are in the cage with you, the player has to jump over a metal bar to get to a lever that will release you from the cage, but the player has to leave Yorda behind, the giants are in the way, you can choose to leave Yorda behind or you can try to go back to her, if you do, you will get crushed, if you don't, you will still get crushed, if you leave her behind, the game shows Yorda crying over your death, after that, you will have to go back to the cage, because the lever that will release you from the cage is on the other side of the cage, so you have to go back from where you came, you will see Yorda's mom, who is a giant, talk to Yorda, then the player has to move the block and the tower, after reaching the top, the player can see the castle from the top of the castle, the player can see Yorda's mom from the top of the castle, if you")

It is not my favorite game, but I think it is a perfect example of a game that can be experienced as art. I think art is the ability of a product to convey a message. Journey conveys a message about the human condition and the relationship between humans and the world. It conveys a message about the need to connect with other humans. It conveys a message about how beautiful the world can be and how beautiful humans can be. It conveys a message about the importance of wonder and awe. It conveys a message about the importance of life and love. It conveys a message about the importance of death and loss. It conveys a message about how futile our existence can be. It conveys a message about the importance of change. It conveys a message about the importance of being present. It conveys a message about how we are all connected. It conveys a message about the importance of hope. It conveys a message about how beautiful life can be. It conveys a message about the importance of being kind to one another and treating each other with respect. It conveys a message about how we can all be heroes. It conveys a message about how much we can accomplish if we work together. It conveys a message about how little we accomplish if we work alone. It conveys a message about how dangerous the world can be. It conveys a message about how the world can be a beautiful place. It conveys a message about how precious life is. It conveys a message about how we should not take life for granted. It conveys a message about how we should appreciate the world around us. It conveys a message about how we should appreciate our existence in the world. It conveys a message about how we should appreciate the time we have with our loved ones. It conveys a message about how we can be better people. It conveys a message about how we can be more empathetic. It conveys a message about how we should treat each other with kindness and respect. It conveys a message about how we should take care of the environment around us. I think Journey is art because you can't convey all of this without making the player feel something. The game is a work of art because it makes the player feel the emotions that the developers wanted the player to feel. The developers wanted the player to feel wonder and awe and beauty and joy.

It's also a platformer in which you can change the view of the world. You can flip the world with the press of a button. I think this is something that's never been done in a game like this. You can also rotate the world as if you were looking at it from the corner.\n\nI think a lot of what made the game Fez so unique is the art style. It's a minimalist style. It's a 2D style, but it's not pixel art or sprites. It's sort of like papercraft. You can make it look like you're playing in a diorama. It's also a style that you could have seen in a cartoon, or a cartoon that has been redrawn in a more minimalist style.

It's a game that makes you think while you play it. It gives you the opportunity to think about what your next move should be and how you could do it in the best way. There is a great challenge in the game. I had to adapt to certain situations and figure out how to solve them. The game made me realize that I had to think differently and that I had to focus on things that I hadn't thought of before. That's called 'thinking outside the box'. This is a great example of art in a game. I noticed that I was developing a new kind of thinking by playing the game and that it made me a better person.

It is an open world RPG in which you can literally get lost in the world for hours. I have played through the game about four times altogether. Every time I play it, I am filled with awe of the artistic achievement that this game is. The graphics are on par with some of the best looking movies at the time of its release. There are many different landscapes, each of which is more beautiful than the next. There are little details that really make the world come alive, such as birds flying overhead and butterflies fluttering around. The creators of this game really put a lot of time and effort into the world, and it really shows. The game is so large and immersive that it really feels like a living breathing world.\n\nResearcher: What were your thoughts and feelings when you experienced the game as art?\n\nParticipant: I was just amazed at the way the creators of this game could take a digital world and make it seem so real.

It\'s hard to describe, but I really felt like I was part of this world, not just playing a game.\n\nResearcher: What kind of qualities do you think are present in a digital game that makes it artistic?\n\nParticipant: I think it\'s a combination of things. A digital game has to have good graphics to be immersive and beautiful, but it also has to have good storytelling and music. If a game has good graphics but no story, then it\'s just an interactive movie. Music is really important too because it can set the mood of a game. I think it\'s these three things together: good graphics, good storytelling and music, and')

The game has no enemies and no violence, but it is still so cathartic and beautiful.\n\nResearcher: Could you describe this experience a little further?\n\nParticipant: The story is told just by going through the world.

It tells a touching story in a way that makes you care about the characters. Even though it takes place in a fantastical setting (the setting is actually sort of a fantasy land, but it has a very realistic feel to it), many of the issues it discusses are very relatable.

This game follows a young man named Wander who is tasked with killing 16 colossi scattered throughout the game world. The land of the game is a vast and beautiful landscape filled with rolling hills, dense forests, and clear blue skies. The game features no spoken dialogue or text. There are only sounds and music that play during the game. The player guides Wander through the world, and the player can choose where to go and what to do. The player can also choose not to do anything, and just explore the land. The game shines when it comes to aesthetics and atmosphere. Everything from the music to the colossi to the landscapes serves to create a sense of wonder and mystery. The colossi are large creatures that were once living beings that have become corrupted and twisted by time and the land. They are massive creatures, and the size of them can be surprising. The colossi are difficult to kill and the player feels a sense of dread as Wander approaches one. The colossi are enormous and they are powerful, and their very presence makes the player feel as though they are small and insignificant. The colossi are beautiful and awe-inspiring, but they are also dangerous and terrifying. One of the game's main themes is that the world is a force of both creation and destruction. The colossi are evidence of this idea- they both give life to the land and they destroy it. I was always excited to see a colossus, but I was also terrified of them. The colossi are beautiful and they are horrifying. They are symbols of life and death, but they are also symbols of beauty and the unknown. I think the game is a good work of art because it is able to create such awe and wonder through gameplay. The player feels awe and wonder as they explore the world, and they feel these emotions as they encounter the colossi. The game makes the player feel small and insignificant. It makes the player feel as though the world is a force of both creation and destruction, and that these two things are equally powerful.

Please describe in detail why you consider this game to be art.\n\nParticipant: I consider the game art because of the experience it gave me. Its visuals and music were captivating and the overall experience was emotional. For example, I felt awe as I was standing on a high mountain peak. I felt joy and a sense of belonging, as I was part of a larger community. I felt a sense of happiness as I was helping others and receiving help from them. I felt a sense of melancholy when I was alone, out in the vast landscape. I felt a sense of unease and suspense as I was advancing through the game without any clear direction. I felt a sense of wonder as I was travelling through the game, exploring dark caves and climbing up high mountains. I felt a sense of sadness as I was leaving my friends behind and continuing my journey alone. I felt a sense of accomplishment as I was finally able to see the ending sequence after a long journey. I felt the sudden urge to jump up and down and scream out loud when I finally saw the ending sequence. I felt the desire to look up at the sky and gaze at the moon and stars. I felt the need to sit quietly and think about the experience I had just had. There were many other feelings I had while playing that game, but I can't remember them all.\n\nResearcher: How did you experience these emotions?\n\nParticipant: While playing, I was concentrating on the game. I was trying to figure out what I had to do and how to get there. I was trying to make sense of the cryptic messages I was receiving. I was trying to find my way through the vast landscape. I was trying to help my fellow travellers. I was trying to help my anonymous friends. I was trying to figure out what to do next.

The way the game plays out is in many ways similar to Bergman\'s film Persona, with its multiple layers of identity and its deep focus on duality, as well as the way the game is able to manipulate the player\'s emotions through its ability to adapt to the player\'s playstyle and the way it is able to create a world that is \'alive\' and reacts to the player\'s actions is very similar to the way Robert Frost\'s poem "The Road Not Taken" creates a world that is constantly changing and has a sort of life of its own. The way the game slowly reveals the story to the player, building up to a climax of sorts, is also very similar to the way a good movie would build up to a conclusion, or a good book would build up to its climax. The player also feels kind of like a detective, trying to piece together the events leading up to the game\'s climax, in a way similar to the way a good book would slowly reveal the story to the reader. Also, the player\'s actions feel meaningful and concrete, rather than arbitrary, and the player\'s actions will have a direct impact on the world around them, which could be considered an artistic way of telling a story.\n\nResearcher: Thank you for your time!\n\nParticipant: You\'re welcome!\n\nAdvertisements')

In my experience, games can be artistic when they are well crafted, when they are emotionally moving or when they evoke a sense of wonder.\n\nResearcher: What kind of games have you played that made you feel that way?\n\nParticipant: Games that have well crafted story lines.

Could you please tell me more about those games?\n\nParticipant: Sure\n\nResearcher: Please tell me more in as much detail as you can.\n\nParticipant: I remember playing a game that had an emotional impact on me and that let me experience a sense of wonder. It was an indie game called "Everybody\'s gone to the rapture". I played this game in 2015 and really loved it. It was a story about a small town in the UK, that was experiencing a religious rapture or apocalypse. The story starts after most people had disappeared and the people that were left in the town were confused. The protagonist was an archaeologist and was set on finding out what had happened. The game was beautiful. You could see that the developers put a lot of effort into the story and the artwork. The game\'s visuals were amazing and the story was very well written. I think that the game evoked a sense of wonder, because you never knew what was going to happen next. You were curious about the story and what had happened to the people of the town. You wanted to understand what was going on and you searched for answers. The game was very emotionally moving. The story was sad and lonely, as the town was empty and getting increasingly more eerie.

I was playing through the main storyline and was a few levels away from the end. The game has you going back in time to fix a mistake you made. I had to repeat a part of the level that I was very good in, but my mind was focused on something else, so I made a mistake and lost the game. I was frustated because I knew I had to replay the level, so I had to go back to a previous time and replay that level. I was thinking about how much I didn't want to do that, when I realized that I was playing a game to avoid experiencing something. That's when I realized that I play this game to avoid dealing with my real life. I play the game to avoid the things that I don't want to deal with. I don't want to deal with my issues, so I play a game. That's when I realized that this game is art. It is a game that makes you think, even though it is a simple game. When you play it, you will experience something that you don't expect.\n\nResearcher: Thank you very much for your time.\n\nResults\n\nThis is an excerpt from the interview, it is in no way representative for the whole interview.\n\nA look into the mind of the player\n\nThis interview helped us to clarify the definition of art when talking about games. Although the player did not directly say that he had experienced a game as art, he brought up an interesting point that he experiences the game in a way that he does not expect. The player described his experience with Braid, which is an on-rails platformer game where you have to go back in time to fix mistakes you have made. The player describes how he was frustrated because he had to replay a level, but when he was done he realized that he plays the game because he doesn't want to deal with his real life. This brought us to the conclusion that the player experiences a game as art when he is taken out of his comfort zone, which is something that he doesn't expect. This can be done by the game itself, like Braid did to the player, or it can be done by the player himself, because the player is aware of the game and uses the game to his advantage. It is important to note that the player did not expect this to happen, and it was an interesting experience for him.\n\nThe")

The interpretation has to be personal and it is not bound to a set of rules. There has to be a sense of agency for the artist and the audience.\n\nNow, I think that my experience with The Path is a good example of art.\n\nI played the first 10 minutes in a very different way than I would have played the same game some years back.

I tried to comprehend the narrative and I found it interesting.\n\nI was very engaged and the artistry was very clear to me. It was very personal and I could relate to it.\n\nThe game was dark, it had a mysterious atmosphere. It was a bit creepy and it felt very real. I could relate to the story and the characters. I felt genuine empathy. It felt very human and very well done.\n\nResearcher: Why do you think that the game experience you remember was art?\n\nParticipant: Well, I think that the feeling of being completely immersed into a video game is something different than watching a movie or reading a book. You are part of the game world, you are interacting with it. You can explore it. You can make decisions.\n\nIt is a different experience.\n\nI think that the game industry has a lot of potential and I think that the potential is not being used.

I used to play a lot of games on my Sega Genesis and I played a lot of games on the PC. I also played a lot of PC games with my friends. We had a pretty large selection of games and some of them were so awesome I don\'t think I will ever forget them.

I had a lot of fun playing games that I thought were fun, but I definitely played some games that I would have never played if they weren\'t art.

I love art and I love music and I love playing games but I didn\'t think these games were art. I thought they were a waste of time. I didn\'t think anything could be art if you had to take the time to play it. I didn\'t think anything could be art if you had to put the time and the effort into playing a game. I didn\'t think anything could be art if you had to do something. I was led to believe that art was something you had to look at. I was led to believe that art was something you had to listen to. I was led to believe that art was something you had to read about. I was led to believe that art was something you had to interact with, but I didn\'t believe that anything could be art if you had to do something.

However, some games are about aesthetics, like Monument Valley or Monument Valley 2. Here it is important to underline that the aesthetic of a game is different from that of a movie or a game. First of all, videogames are interactive and thus the player can be part of the experience. This brings a new level of engagement. Second, the game is build upon rules and mechanics, which may permit an interactive narrative and a variety of experiences. The aesthetic of a game is, thus, not a matter of chance, but is based on a structure of rules.\n\nReferences\n\nAarseth, E. (2004). Play it again, Sam: On the completionist project in videogames.

I can\'t really describe how it made me feel, but it was a very unique experience. What people don\'t realize is that the environment around you can influence how you feel. I felt alone, yet I wasn\'t. The music, the visuals, and the sound effects were all so powerful. The game didn\'t even have a language, and yet it made me feel like I was on some kind of journey. Everything was just so beautiful.\n\nResearcher: Would you like to add anything else?\n\nParticipant: I don\'t think so.\n\nResearcher: Well, thank you for your time!\n\nParticipant: You\'re welcome!\n\nI can\'t help but feel I\'m left with more questions than answers. How can we explore these experiences? How can we objectively classify and describe them? How can we give video games their rightful place as art, when they are so unlike other forms of art? These questions were in my mind as I was reading the interview transcript. Then, it hit me: games are art, but that\'s not all. They\'re something else too â€” something that\'s even more important, and something that we can\'t experience with any other medium.\n\nVideo games are experience\n\nIn his book Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud, a comic theorist, describes a comic in three layers: the image, the word, and the experience. The image is the medium through which the artist conveys the story to the reader. The word is the text that provides an additional layer of interpretation for the reader. The experience is the exchange between the reader and the comic, the reader\'s individual reaction which is unique to each person. McCloud believes that the experience is the most important part of a comic.\n\nI believe that video games are more than just art. They are experience. McCloud\'s definition also applies to video games. Video games are the images through which the story is conveyed. The story is the word that provides an additional layer of interpretation for the player. The experience is the exchange between the player and the game, the player\'s individual reaction which is unique to each person.\n\nVideo games are experience. They are a dynamic exchange between the player and the game, and this exchange is unique to each player. We can not share the same experience, but we can exchange our experiences. We can experience the same images, the same actions, the same stories, but how')

It is a first-person game, set in an old house that has been recently bought by a family. The player steps in the shoes of Kaitlin, the youngest daughter of the family. The player has to explore the house to unveil the story. The house looks like it has been abandoned for a few weeks, but it is actually the player who has taken up the role of Kaitlin, so the player is actually visiting her home. There are various items scattered around the house, and some of them are related to the story. The player has to play with items, read the notes the family left around the house, listen to the messages on the answering machine and so on. The game has a very strong narrative, and it focuses on its characters and their lives. The player has to try to be Kaitlin and to experience her life. The player has to walk around the house, listen to various messages or even watch a video. It is a very strong experience, and it makes the player think about the characters.

I had heard about this game, and that it was based on the experience of the player, and not so much on the game itself. To me, it seemed like a game that wanted to be a spiritual experience. It's music is beautiful, and it's meaning is nice. I don't think I've ever played a game that has the same feeling as Journey. I would even go as far as to say that it doesn't feel like a game. It just feels like a different experience.\n\nResearcher: What was it about the game that made you feel this way?\n\nParticipant: I've never played a game that tells its story so well. The game is very simple, and easy to understand. The game doesn't explain anything, and it's up to you to interpret the meaning of it. It isn't like a typical game where you have to play through the story line. It's all about the journey, and not the destination.\n\nResearcher: What was it that influenced you about the game?\n\nParticipant: The music was probably the biggest influence. It was very soothing, and it made me feel really relaxed. I also thought the game was very pretty, and the drawings were really nice. The game also made me think about my own life, and it made me think about what I want to achieve.\n\nResearcher: Did you ever experience a digital game as art before?\n\nParticipant: I've never really thought about it much, but I guess I did experience a game as art before. I guess the first game that I played that I thought was art was the Journey game.\n\nResearcher: Are there any other games that you would consider art?\n\nParticipant: I'd say Journey is the only game I know that I would consider art.\n\nResearcher: Do you still think of video games as art after this interview?\n\nParticipant: Yes, I do. I never really thought of video games as art before, but this interview made me realize that video games are art.\n\nResearcher: Why did you decide to play Journey?\n\nParticipant: I heard about the game through a friend, and I've heard that it can be a very spiritual experience.

After hearing all the hype about it, I decided to give it a try. I had already played many games before, so I didn't really expect to feel something new. Then I started it and was blown away by how different it was from all the other games I played before. It wasn't just a game, it was a one of a kind experience. The level of detail was stunning. The way the whole world was created was unique. It was so well thought-through. It was very clever to use the same mechanic for both fighting and puzzles. I really liked how the game made you feel that you were just an ordinary person stuck in the situation, not some kind of super hero, even though you are. You were forced to improvise and use some of your environment in order to solve the puzzles. It's not just about fighting enemies, it's about how the whole world has been designed.

Well, there is this game called Journey. It is a game where you play as a traveler, a nameless traveler, and you travel though the desert. You travel alone, but there is an NPC, a monk of sorts, who travels with you. He is created by the developers, and you can see him on your screen. The point of the game is to reach a mountain in the distance. You travel across sand dunes, jump over deep canyons, ride on the back of a giant bird, slay monsters, get power-ups, and so on. The game is actually very beautiful, and it has a really immersive world. The visuals are stunning and the game really feels alive, as you can see the sun setting and rising, and the shadows of the sun on the sand. There is an ambient soundtrack in the background, and you can even sing with other players, which is great.\n\nYou can see the sun setting and rising in Journey.\n\nIn the game, you activate a power-up by pressing the triangle button.

It was a game that had a very unique style that you would normally not find in any game. The style included a mix of a dark world full of monsters and humans trying to survive in it. It had a unique combination of creatures including vampires, werewolves, and even mages. This created a unique atmosphere where you would not be able to tell who was good and who was bad. The game had a very unique and different combat system for the modern RPG games that were being released at that time. This was where you had to use a combination of your melee and ranged weapons to fight the enemies and complete the quests. You could even use your vampiric powers to mesmerize your opponents. The game also had a very unique way of telling the story through multiple sources including computer terminals, e-mail messages, and even phone calls. This created an atmosphere where you felt as if you were part of that world. The game also had a very unique way of creating the characters to look different from one another through facial hair, scars, and even a tattoo on their bodies.
