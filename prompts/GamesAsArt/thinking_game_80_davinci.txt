 Journey. I played it with a friend. The game was so beautiful and so calming. The game was not challenging, it was for sure art. The meaning behind the game was about connecting with another person, about love, about being there for another person. When you play the game, you feel everything that is going on the screen. I can't remember exactly what I was thinking, but I remember this feeling that I was thinking about real life and how to make it better. How to make people better. How to make friends better. I remember thinking about how I can't be there for my friend all the time, but the game showed me different. I got the feeling that I need to be there for my friend all the time and that I can't leave him alone. I don't know, I remember thinking about a lot of things. But I remember that feeling of love. Not the love between two people. I don't know, it was a different love. The love for humanity. The love for my friend. The love for myself.
