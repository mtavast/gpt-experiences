 Journey, which is a game that I really love. It's a game that does not have any plot, but it has an emotional story. You start the game as a robed figure in a vast desert. You are trying to reach the summit of a mountain. The game itself is very simple, it's a platformer, and as you reach the higher levels you feel as if you are growing as a person. You start off in this vast desert, but as you climb the mountains and reach higher levels in the game, you see more wonderful sites. You feel as if you're in a great journey. You see beautiful mountains, and lush green grass, and at the top of the mountain, you see the sun. It is a beautiful sight to behold. The music is wonderful as well, it's this soft and peaceful music, and it just makes you feel good. You can see that it's not a game with a story, it's not a game with much puzzle or challenge, but the whole thing just makes you feel good, and at the end of the game, you feel as if you accomplished a goal, and you feel as if you have grown as a person. You also feel as if you were part of the game, and that you made an impact on the game world.
