 NieR. NieR is a game with a beautiful soundtrack and great voice acting, and the plot involves existentialism. It is about a father who gives up his life to give his daughter a chance to live. It is about death, and life, and gives a different perspective on existence. I really connected with the characters who were in the same situation as the player. It was very emotional, especially when I was playing the game for the second time and knowing the fate of the characters.
