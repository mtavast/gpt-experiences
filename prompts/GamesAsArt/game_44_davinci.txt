 The first time I ever experienced a digital game as art was when I was playing Portal. I had already played it before, but I was playing it again for school. I was taking this class where we had to play a game and write a paper about it. I chose Portal because I knew the game and I was interested in playing it again. I played the game in about a week, but I had to work on it when I had time. I played it on and off. I would go for about an hour, and then I would play another game for an hour or two. I am someone who has a lot of energy, so I didn't want to spend my whole time on a game. I would play other games and then come back to Portal.
