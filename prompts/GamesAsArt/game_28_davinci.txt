 It is hard to describe it. It is not like any other experience I had. It was not like watching a movie or playing a game. It was like entering an other reality. I felt like I was in a different world, but it was like walking inside a movie. The sounds, the music, the characters, the movements, the interactions, everything was perfect. It was like I was confronting and experiencing a real reality. I felt like I was one of the characters. I felt like I was existing in that world. I felt like I was a part of it. I was not the controller of the game, the game was the controller of me. I am not sure if I can explain it correctly, but I really enjoyed it. I was able to feel so many things in that game.
