 The first time I played Shadow of the Colossus, I felt like I was watching a movie. The music and the graphics were amazing. It's a story about a boy who lost a loved one and wants to bring him back to life. So to achieve this he needs to kill 16 colossi. His first colossus is really easy to kill. After he defeats the first one, a bigger and more powerful colossus is waiting for him. The most powerful colossus is the last one. After you beat all the colossi, you will have to fight against this one. You have to shoot him with your bow and arrows to kill him. This colossus is really hard to kill. After some time, I defeated the colossus and the story continues. I felt really sad when I watched this movie. It was a very emotional movie for me.
