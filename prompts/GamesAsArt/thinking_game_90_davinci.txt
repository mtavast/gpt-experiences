 Dark Souls. It's a game that was released in 2011. The game itself has a great atmosphere that is set by the music, the graphics and the design of the levels. It has a dark feel to it and a certain mood. It's a game that makes you think while you play it. It gives you the opportunity to think about what your next move should be and how you could do it in the best way. There is a great challenge in the game. I had to adapt to certain situations and figure out how to solve them. The game made me realize that I had to think differently and that I had to focus on things that I hadn't thought of before. That's called 'thinking outside the box'. This is a great example of art in a game. I noticed that I was developing a new kind of thinking by playing the game and that it made me a better person. It's a game that makes you feel emotions, that gives you an experience that you will remember. It's a game that you can learn a lot from.
