 The game I experienced as art was a mobile game called Monument Valley. It is a puzzle game in which you manipulate the environment to guide a princess through various levels. The game makes use of various geometric shapes to make the puzzles more difficult. You align a set of shapes to create a path for the princess to walk on. This is especially complicated in later levels.
