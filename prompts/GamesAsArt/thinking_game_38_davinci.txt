 Journey. I had a lot of thoughts when I played it. The most important thought that I had was "I am creating art as I play this game." I felt very connected with the game and I felt very free while playing. I didn't have a goal in the game, and I was doing everything I wanted to do. I was just exploring the world and enjoying the game. I made some drawings of the game. They are not very good, but I thought it would be interesting to draw the game. They are really abstract. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt like I was creating art while playing the game.
