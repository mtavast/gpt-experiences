 Journey, which I played in 2013 with my partner at the time. I enjoyed the game very much and it had an aesthetic that reminded me of art. I remember being very touched by my partner and me having to work together to reach a goal that we both needed to accomplish. I remember thinking that this made a great metaphor for relationships in general.
