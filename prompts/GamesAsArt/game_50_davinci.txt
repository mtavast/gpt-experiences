 It was a simple game, but the story was so good that I finished the game with tears in my eyes. The ending was so sad, so moving, and I will never forget it. The graphics were not great, but just the story and the way it was told was amazing. The protagonist had a sad but happy life. She was a very nice person and she made me think about my life. The main message of the game was that life can just go on like nothing has happened and that you can be happy anyway.
