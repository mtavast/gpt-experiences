 "I was in my room watching a game I had been playing a few days ago. It was a game called 'A New World'. I noticed, that after the game was finished, that something had been added to it. A picture which was not supposed to be there, it turned out to be the game's main character. I have never seen anything like this in any game before, so it was a surprise."
