 Journey. I played this game on the Playstation 3 and it was very challenging. It's a very beautiful game, the music, and the graphics were very well done. The game is very relaxing to me. I don't get frustrated because it is very challenging as well. The game takes a long time to master and it has a story. I believe the game has a message that I can interpret in many ways.
