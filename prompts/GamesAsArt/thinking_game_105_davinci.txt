 "Journey". I can't really describe how it made me feel, but it was a very unique experience. What people don't realize is that the environment around you can influence how you feel. I felt alone, yet I wasn't. The music, the visuals, and the sound effects were all so powerful. The game didn't even have a language, and yet it made me feel like I was on some kind of journey. Everything was just so beautiful.
