 There is a game called "The Banner Saga." It is a turn-based RPG, with some strategy elements. It's art in its simplicity. It doesn't have to have a lot of things in it to be art. It's the story, the setting, the music, the little details that make it art. I could easily see a story like this being a novel, but the fact that it's a video game just makes it more amazing.
