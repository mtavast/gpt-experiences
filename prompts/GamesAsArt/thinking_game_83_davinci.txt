 "The Last of Us". It was a game I played on my PlayStation 3, and it was one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had. The story was very well written. It was very detailed, and it was very emotional. There were a lot of scenes that were very touching, and it made me feel a lot of different emotions. It was very raw, and it was very real. I think that's what made me see it as art. It wasn't just a game, it was an experience, and it was an experience that a lot of people can relate to. It was an experience that I can relate to. It was something that changed my life, and it changed my perspective on a lot of things. It made me think about life, and it made me think about people, and it made me think about the world in a lot of different ways. It made me appreciate certain things more. It made me appreciate my family, and the people I love, and the life that I have, and the things that I have. I think it made me more grateful for the things I have. I think it made me more grateful for the life I have, and the things I have, and the people I have. I got in touch with my feelings a lot more because of this game. I think the game made me a better person. It made me a better person because it made me think about life in a way that I never thought about it before. I think it's a game that everybody should play. I think it's a game that everybody should experience. It's not just a game. It's so much more than a game. It's an experience, and I have a lot of respect for this game. I think it should be recognized as art.
