 Half Life 2 by Valve. When I played this game I felt like I was in a movie. You play in the world of Half Life and you have to save the world. You have to bring peace and freedom to the people. In this kind of game you have to make choices and they have an impact on the story and the game. You have to make decisions like: should I kill these people or not? Should I kill this person? Or should I try to find another way? This really made me think about what kind of person I am. Half Life 2 is really a very nice game and should be considered as a piece of art. In this game you really have to think about your actions and what they will bring to the people. I would rate this game as an A+ in my opinion. I really enjoyed this game and I think that many players would also like to play this game. Half Life 2 is a game that I will remember for a long time.
