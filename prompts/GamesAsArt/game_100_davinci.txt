 My first experience with art in a video game was with the game Shadow of the Colossus. This game follows a young man named Wander who is tasked with killing 16 colossi scattered throughout the game world. The land of the game is a vast and beautiful landscape filled with rolling hills, dense forests, and clear blue skies. The game features no spoken dialogue or text. There are only sounds and music that play during the game. The player guides Wander through the world, and the player can choose where to go and what to do. The player can also choose not to do anything, and just explore the land. The game shines when it comes to aesthetics and atmosphere. Everything from the music to the colossi to the landscapes serves to create a sense of wonder and mystery. The colossi are large creatures that were once living beings that have become corrupted and twisted by time and the land. They are massive creatures, and the size of them can be surprising. The colossi are difficult to kill and the player feels a sense of dread as Wander approaches one. The colossi are enormous and they are powerful, and their very presence makes the player feel as though they are small and insignificant. The colossi are beautiful and awe-inspiring, but they are also dangerous and terrifying. One of the game's main themes is that the world is a force of both creation and destruction. The colossi are evidence of this idea- they both give life to the land and they destroy it. I was always excited to see a colossus, but I was also terrified of them. The colossi are beautiful and they are horrifying. They are symbols of life and death, but they are also symbols of beauty and the unknown. I think the game is a good work of art because it is able to create such awe and wonder through gameplay. The player feels awe and wonder as they explore the world, and they feel these emotions as they encounter the colossi. The game makes the player feel small and insignificant. It makes the player feel as though the world is a force of both creation and destruction, and that these two things are equally powerful. I think this game is beautiful and it is a good work of art.
