 Journey (2012) by thatgamecompany. The game is very abstract, but it also has a stunning visual design and a very compelling narrative. The way you traverse the game world is very smooth and the emotional impact of the game is very intense. It is not only an enjoyable game, but it is also an experience that makes you think. It's so different from most other games. Even the weirdest parts of the game make it feel like an experience that is unique and unlike anything else. It is hard to explain exactly why I think the game is art, other than the fact that the game is so different from most other games.
