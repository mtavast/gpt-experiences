 Journey, which I played in 2012, right when it came out. At that time I was struggling a lot with my life, and had to move back in with my parents, after living independently for several years. I was very angry and disappointed with my life, and most of all with myself. The game Journey is a spiritual game, and it helped me a lot to get through this rough time. It made me realize that I had to start over, and that it's okay to make mistakes, as long as I learn from them. I started to think of myself as a child of the universe. I played through the game with a friend, and we connected a lot over the game, without ever meeting each other. The game was very calming and beautiful, but not full of action. So I would say that Journey is a very interactive, but passive experience, because you can't really influence the outcome of the game. But I was really touched by it, and in my opinion it is a very well made game.
