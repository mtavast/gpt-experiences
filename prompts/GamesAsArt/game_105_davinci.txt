 I don't know if everyone has had the same kind of experience but I have. I like to play games that I can really get into. The feeling of immersion is important to me if I am going to spend a lot of time playing a game. Sometimes, I'll get so caught up in the game that I can't see the screen anymore. It is like the game is in my head. I can feel it. I can taste it. I can feel the sun beating down on me, and I can smell the grass. I can hear the wind and the sounds of the game. I can even feel the controller in my hands. It is so real, so vivid. It is like I am really there, in that virtual world.
