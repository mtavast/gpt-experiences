 OK. There was a game I played with a friend. It was a map for the game Team Fortress 2. This is a game where we can play with a team against another team and try to destroy the opposite team. Each team has to defend their base and try to destroy the base of the other team. We had picked the map "Badlands" and played it for a while. We were cooperating and tried to find the best way to defend our base and attack the other team's base. We worked together, communicated with each other, and enjoyed the game. When we destroyed the other team's base we even celebrated by cheering and jumping. This is just one example of the many experiences I had.
