 I was playing Limbo by Playdead. The game had a large impact on me. There are parts in the game that are very hard to understand your environment and the exact way of moving forward. It was very challenging, and sometimes I felt a little frustrated. When I finally reached the end, I realized that the game was more than just about solving puzzles, it was about emotions. The game had done a great job to build up the mood, and it was very touching.
