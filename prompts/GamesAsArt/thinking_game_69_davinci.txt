 Journey. It's a game that has no words, and the main storyline is rather short, but I found it much more engaging than any other game I've played. The game focus is on the visuals and the music. The visuals are beautiful and every frame was carefully thought out. The music is extremely calming without sounding repetitive. The music and visuals are perfectly blended and add greatly to the experience. The game offers a single player mode, but I played the multiplayer mode, and I found it great to see other players on the same journey as you. The game is short, but beautiful, and I can see myself coming back to it in the future.
