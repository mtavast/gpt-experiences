 Bioshock Infinite. I think it was one of the most meaningful and interactive games I've played. You play as a character that is trying to find his way to a special city. The visual and auditory way that the game was made to look and sound was very artistic. It was considered a work of art because of its amazing graphics and music. It was a very emotional experience that you could create yourself. It was a game that you had to play to understand. It was a very fantasy-like game that actually made you think. You could go to different places, and the city was beautiful. The way that they made the city was so interesting. It was like a world that you could create yourself. It was a game that made me think of all the things that could be. It made me think of what it would be like if I was actually there. It was very interesting and a great game.
