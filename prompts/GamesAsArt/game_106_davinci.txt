 The game was Braid. I was playing through the main storyline and was a few levels away from the end. The game has you going back in time to fix a mistake you made. I had to repeat a part of the level that I was very good in, but my mind was focused on something else, so I made a mistake and lost the game. I was frustated because I knew I had to replay the level, so I had to go back to a previous time and replay that level. I was thinking about how much I didn't want to do that, when I realized that I was playing a game to avoid experiencing something. That's when I realized that I play this game to avoid dealing with my real life. I play the game to avoid the things that I don't want to deal with. I don't want to deal with my issues, so I play a game. That's when I realized that this game is art. It is a game that makes you think, even though it is a simple game. When you play it, you will experience something that you don't expect.
