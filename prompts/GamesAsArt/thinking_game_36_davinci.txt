 I'm currently playing, which is "Kentucky Route Zero." I am not very far into the game yet, but I'm enjoying it. It reminds me of a few other games I've played, but it is different in a lot of aspects. I love that the game is set in the real world. I don't know why, but I really like that. It makes it easy for me to relate to the characters and the world. There are some supernatural elements in the game, but the overall tone is very dark and sad. And the music is just amazing! I can't put into words how much I like the music. The game uses radio and telephone sounds to build the mood and atmosphere. I really like that. I heard a song on the radio the other day that I hadn't heard for a long time, and I don't even remember why I liked it so much back then. But when I heard it in the game, it triggered that memory. And I thought, "Oh my God, this is such a great game!"
