 I am a big fan of the Metal Gear series, and one of my favourite games is Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. I played this game many times, and I always had a lot of fun with it. It's a stealth game, and it's also a survival game. I always liked the amazing design of the game, and the story is just perfect (I think that the story in this game is just so much better than in all the other Metal Gear games). It's a very cinematic game, and it's very emotional. It's a very hard game, and it requires a lot of patience. I remember that I was really passionate about this game, and I was very happy to have found a game that I would play very often. I was very surprised by the graphics of this game, because at that time (2004) it was the best looking game that I had ever played. I could say a lot more about this game, but I think that this should be enough to show you what this game means to me.
