 Journey by Thatgamecompany. It is a small but beautiful game, that makes you feel a sense of wonder and awe. It's a game that doesn't have many objectives, but you still feel a sense of progression. The game was designed by Jenova Chen who also designed flOw, a game that is also a very calm and serene experience. You get the sense that he's trying to make games that are more focused on the emotional experience and less on the challenges of the games. He wants to make games that make you feel the way you would feel when you are experiencing different art forms. To me, Journey was a game that brought up many emotions for me. I felt a sense of wonder that was only brought up by art of nature. To me, this game was clearly a game that was trying to be art.
