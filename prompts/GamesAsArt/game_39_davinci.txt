 I experience art in the games I play when the graphics are so realistic that I sometimes forget that I'm playing a game. I get immersed in the game so much that I forget everything around me. I can feel the pain, fear, joy, and the sadness in the game. The games that have had this effect on me are Crysis, Crysis Warhead, and Crysis 2. These games are graphically so beautiful that I sometimes get lost in the world. I feel like I am actually there.
