 Journey. This game was created by Thatgamecompany for the PlayStation 3 and was released in 2012. The game is about the player being a robed figure exploring a vast desert environment on the way to a mountain in the distance. On the way, the player picks up scarf-like fabrics and "dances" with them to activate floating stone columns that allow the player to move further in the game.
