 Journey, which was released a couple of years ago. I was very impressed by the graphics and the music. Especially the music. The way it was composed and the way it was presented in the game was very beautiful. I have never experienced anything of that caliber in any other game. The environment looked very realistic, and the way the music was presented in the game was just perfect. It was very relaxing and the graphics were very nice as well. I was so impressed with this game that I started to watch Youtube videos about it. I found a video, which seemed to be some kind of documentary about the game. I found this video very interesting because it was talking about how the developers created this game. They made it for a documentary and later they decided to make it a commercial game. The documentary showed how the game was created. I was very impressed by how they made this game. The landscapes in the game were very beautiful, and the music was very relaxing. I was also impressed by the way the developers made the game. The way they created the game was very impressive and creative. This game gave me the feeling that the developers really wanted to create something beautiful. I was very impressed by this game and it definitely gave me the feeling that it was art.
