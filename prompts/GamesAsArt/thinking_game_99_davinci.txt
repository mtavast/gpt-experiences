 Journey, developed by thatgamecompany. The game is set in a vast desert and the player must travel to a mountain in the middle of it. The experience is calming and you have to communicate with other players by left-clicking your mouse to draw a symbol in the sand. It is beautiful and peaceful. The music is the most important part of the game. It's like nothing I've ever heard before. It sounds like an old singing voice from some rocky mountains. The sound of sand blowing in the wind is also an important part of the game.
