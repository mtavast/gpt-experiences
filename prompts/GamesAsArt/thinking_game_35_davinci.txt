 Journey. It's a game for the PS3 that was released in 2012. I experienced this game as art because of the simple but profound experience I had. The game was very quiet, it was only me and another player in the game, traveling through desert lands. There were no other clues or hints that we were playing with another person. The game is very simple, we were just walking through sand dunes, mountains and valleys, using our scarf as a jump rope to climb, at the end of the game there is a mountain that we have to climb, we can only climb it if we help each other. It's a very simple game, but a very profound game, it touches me deeper than any other game has, it felt like I was really there, it was a great experience. I was amazed and deeply touched by this game, I felt like I was part of the world, and it was wonderful, I really felt that this game was art.
