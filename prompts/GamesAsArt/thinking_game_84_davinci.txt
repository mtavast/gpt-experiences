 Journey, the one that's been out for the PlayStation. It has been around a long time and I think it's been out for at least four years now. I don't play video games often because they take up a lot of time and I already have a lot of hobbies and things to do. I first heard about Journey in one of the video game magazines my friends buy. The cover story was about this game. They said it was a game like no other. It was a very different game, not your typical game with shooting and killing.

When it starts to unravel, it means you are almost at the end of the journey. The scarf is also the end of the journey and the beginning of a new journey. There are also a lot of other things in the game that you can see, but I don't want to spoil the experience for the people who are going to play it. I played this game while sitting on my couch in the evenings. I like to play it when it's just the two of us, and I like to pla
