 Journey. I was deeply affected by the experience of playing it. It had a profound impact on me and I felt like it was art. The setting and mood created by the music, visuals and colors were breathtaking. The music was very emotional and I felt that the game was trying to tell me something, that I should feel something about the story of the game, but I didn't know what.
