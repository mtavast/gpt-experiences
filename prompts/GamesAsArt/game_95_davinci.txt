 I played a game called Journey. I had a strong feeling of awe and wonder during as I played the game. It was a sensation of awe and wonder that I had never experienced playing a game before. It felt like I was wandering through a beautiful world, exploring more and more of it. The game was very light hearted, but it also had a certain amount of seriousness to it. It was a game that was in a way about life and death, and how beautiful life can be no matter what. I enjoyed the game and I enjoyed the feeling of playing it. I think the game is one that can bring a person to a state of being where they can think of life and death and other serious things while still having a feeling of awe and wonder.
