 I loved the game Journey. It was a very powerful experience for me. The game is about a desert with a mountain in the distance. You start out in the desert and you see ruins and assorted ruins along the way as you progress toward the mountain. The game consists of players travelling through the desert as a spot on the screen. You play as a robed figure in a desert with no other players visible. The game gives you the option to interact with other players. When you come across another robed player, you will play the game together as a symbol of the experience of finding a connection with another human being. But you are not allowed to communicate with each other. The game picks up an instrument that is associated with you and the other player, and the two of you will play the instrument in tandem. The game is incredibly beautiful and the music is wonderful. If you make it all the way to the end, you see a mountain silhouetted against the sky.
