 I am currently playing Dishonored, and it is one of the most artistic experiences I have ever had in a video game. The way the game plays out is in many ways similar to Bergman's film Persona, with its multiple layers of identity and its deep focus on duality, as well as the way the game is able to manipulate the player's emotions through its ability to adapt to the player's playstyle and the way it is able to create a world that is 'alive' and reacts to the player's actions is very similar to the way Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken" creates a world that is constantly changing and has a sort of life of its own. The way the game slowly reveals the story to the player, building up to a climax of sorts, is also very similar to the way a good movie would build up to a conclusion, or a good book would build up to its climax. The player also feels kind of like a detective, trying to piece together the events leading up to the game's climax, in a way similar to the way a good book would slowly reveal the story to the reader. Also, the player's actions feel meaningful and concrete, rather than arbitrary, and the player's actions will have a direct impact on the world around them, which could be considered an artistic way of telling a story.
