 I've always been a huge fan of the Metal Gear Solid series. I was a little skeptical of the game to begin with, but it quickly became a favorite. The game was fun and interesting, but the story was what made me love it. I do not remember when exactly it happened, but there was a moment in the game where I realized it was art. It was a moment that was very emotional, which was completely unexpected. I will never forget the feeling of that moment. I was stunned by it. I couldn't believe what I was feeling.
