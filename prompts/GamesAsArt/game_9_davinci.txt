 I played The Last Guardian on PS4. It is a game I have been looking forward to for years. It was very emotional for me. I grew up with the Zelda series, and they had to reboot the series after the 3D game. I had very high expectations for this game being that it was the newest game in that series. I was very happy to get to play this game. The way the game plays was very familiar to me. It brought me back to my childhood. It was very emotional to play a game that I had played so long ago. I did not experience the game as art, until I heard the music. They did not put any music in the game, which left me feeling a little empty. After playing the game for a few hours, I decided to go on youtube and listen to the music from the game. I fell in love with the game, music, and story after hearing the music. It made me realize how much thought was put into the music. I started to play the game with headphones on. I felt like I was experiencing the game as art.
