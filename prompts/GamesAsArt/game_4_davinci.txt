 I will try to describe my experience, but it is hard to do so. I think a game like Journey fits in the concept of art. It is not about the game itself, but it is about the impression it leaves on me and the thoughts it makes me think. The game is a journey, where you walk through a vast desert. The world of the game is bright and colourful, even though there is not much to see. The game is mysterious, and you don't know what you are looking for. You just walk through the desert. The only way to know your position is by a marker on the ground. You walk across this vast world, but there is only the marker on the ground to tell you where you are. At some points, you meet other players on your journey. I really loved that in the game. You were never sure what the other player would do, so you had to be very careful. If you met each other, you could also help each other. The game feels a bit like an art installation. There just is the game and you. You walk through this world, and you experience the game. The game is about being there and experiencing the world, not about solving puzzles or getting a goal.
