 It's hard to pinpoint one specific example. One that sticks out in my mind is a game that I played on my Macbook. It was a game that was free to play, although I never played it online. It was called "The Company of Myself". It's hard to describe exactly why I thought it was art. I just remember feeling a sense of wonder when I started it up and a sense of dread when I was playing it. I didn't like the art style, per se. The graphics were pixelated and, at times, they were just colored rectangles. But there was something about the game that made me keep coming back to it. I'm not sure if it was the atmosphere, the music, the gameplay, or the story. I believe the game was about the main character, who was some kind of blob, trying to get bigger and you had to do something in order to get bigger. I don't remember what. I think the game was supposed to be some sort of commentary on games and how they are made and who makes them. I don't know why I thought that, but that is what I got from the game. I remember that the game was getting harder and harder as I kept playing it. There were no checkpoints and you couldn't get any more lives. You had to start all the way over if you died. I think there was a part in the game where I had to jump across a series of platforms and if I didn't make it, I would die. I kept trying and trying to get it right. I had to get it right. I died so many times, but I didn't give up. The game was getting harder and harder, but I had to keep going. Finally, after what seemed like hours, I made it across all the platforms. I was so happy that I beat it. I was breathing heavily and I felt like I had accomplished something. It felt good. It felt right. It was just a game, but it was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had. I felt like I had just won a game of Super Smash Bros. Melee.
