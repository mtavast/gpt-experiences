 Journey (2012). I was not sure if I should be playing it or just enjoying the scenery. I was not sure if it was art, or just pretty pictures. I was not sure if it was a game, or just interactive art. I was not sure if I had to do anything or just sit back and enjoy the ride. What I do know is that Journey is a beautiful game with a lot of thought put into it, and it was designed to be a game. It was made to be played, to be enjoyed, to be shared with others, and to be played again. It is a game that allows you to experience the world through someone else's eyes, and it is a game that allows you to be alone with your thoughts. I do not know if Journey is art, but I know that I enjoyed playing it and enjoyed the ride.
