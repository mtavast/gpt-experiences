 I'm not sure how to answer this. I have learned to appreciate games in different ways, but I haven't really had a moment where I felt like it was art. When I played Limbo years ago, I remember feeling like it was art. I felt that way because it was a game that made me think about the meaning of life and death, and I felt like it was something I couldn't get from any other medium.
