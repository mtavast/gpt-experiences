 The game I am going to describe is "Deus Ex: Human Revolution", which is a game that I play on my own, without an adult supervision. It is a very well designed game, and the environment, the characters, and the music are all artfully done. The game has many different endings and I have not yet seen all of them. The one ending I have experienced is very well done and thought out. In the game, there are many different ways to end it. The ending I experienced is one that I don't want to spoil for anyone else who might play the game in the future.
