 "Life is Strange" by Dontnod Entertainment. It tells the story of a teenage girl named Max Caulfield who has the ability to rewind time at any point, so that she can go back and try to change whatever she wants about the past. But Max doesn't necessarily have to follow the path of least resistance. She doesn't have to use her power to avoid dangerous situations. She doesn't have to use it to accomplish everything that is possible to accomplish in this world. The game encourages players to use Max's ability to rewind time to change their own feelings and thoughts about the world and the actions they are doing, and to contemplate the meaning of their existence.
