 I will try to recount one experience I had with a digital game I played on my computer. I remember I was about 12 years old, and my dad had just purchased a new computer. I can still remember the excitement of finally having a computer of my own. I spent my weekends playing games and exploring the internet. I remember one day that I had some free time and I decided to play a game I had recently downloaded. It was a free game, you know, the type of game that is fun but not too challenging or complicated. You can play it and get a fun experience out of it, but it is not something you necessarily have to play.
