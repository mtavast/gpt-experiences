 I have experienced a digital game as art. It was a game called Dear Esther. It was designed to be an experience like a novel. It was an art based game. It was very unique and very emotional for me. I played it for an experience and I felt it was art. I felt like I was in a movie or a novel. It was so different from other games. I was moved to tears at some points and I felt the story of the game. I played it to experience it. I don't really play games, but this game was so different from the others.
