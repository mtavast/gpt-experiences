 Shadow of the Colossus. I bought this game with my PlayStation 2 when it came out and I played it once. I was really impressed by the game's graphics and the very unusual colossi. At the time, I didn't really know much about art so I was not able to say if the game was art or not but when I played the game I felt like I was experiencing another culture. I felt like I was experiencing how people in ancient Japan may have felt when they discovered the world, and the feeling of being lost in such a new world.
