 "Uncharted 4", the last game of the series. I played it on my PS4 and I finished it in about 4 days. At first, I was skeptic, because I have never played a game like that before. But the controls were so good, the cutscenes were so well made with motion capture, that I really got into the story. The story was about a group of survivors of a great war, who were trying to rebuild their lives. It was all about family, sacrifice and love. The story was so well made, that I actually cried at the end. And the game was only a few hours long. It was an emotional journey for me, I felt like I was there. I felt like I knew the characters and I felt like they were in real life. I felt like the game was no longer a game, but a real movie. I felt like this game was a pure art.
