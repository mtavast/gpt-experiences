 I remember when I played the game Journey for the first time. I had heard about this game, and that it was based on the experience of the player, and not so much on the game itself. To me, it seemed like a game that wanted to be a spiritual experience. It's music is beautiful, and it's meaning is nice. I don't think I've ever played a game that has the same feeling as Journey. I would even go as far as to say that it doesn't feel like a game. It just feels like a different experience.
