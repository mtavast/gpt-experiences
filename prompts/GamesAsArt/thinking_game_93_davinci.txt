 To the Moon, which is a sort of adventure game about two doctors who can enter people's memories and change them in order to fulfil their wishes. It actually plays out more like a movie, with the player just pressing up and down to move between different scenes. It's really well-written, with characters that are very likeable and memorable, and the plot is very sweet and touching. It's also very short; I finished it in less than three hours.
