 It was a few years ago, at a time when I was still a student. I had a lot of stress and I was worried about my future. I bought Bioshock, and I was so happy that I could immerse myself in Rapture. I could forget my troubles, and I was able to think about many things. I was able to think about myself, about the world, about life and death, and about everything that I could not think about in the first place. I was able to think about the meaning of my existence. I remember when I came back to reality, I felt like a new person. I was fascinated by my own existence and by the concept of existence in general. I had never felt this way before. This is the experience of the game that I have not experienced before.
