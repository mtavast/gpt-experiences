 Journey, what a raw, emotional, and beautiful game. It's hard to explain why exactly it hit me like that, but I can try. The game is about the feeling of being disconnected from the world, and feeling like you're not part of the world. The environment is so surreal and alien, and there's no way to communicate with the other people in the game. The music made me feel the same way as I feel when I'm completely alone, and I felt like I was being brought back to the time when I was little, before I had any friends, and I didn't know what was going on with the world. I was a blank slate, and Journey made me feel that way again. I was just another person in the crowd, just like I was when I was little. I was being brought back to the sense of confusion and helplessness I felt when I was little, but at the same time I was being taken out of the world. The game made me feel like I was being taken away from the world that I know, and I felt reconnected to the world that I didn't know. The game made me feel like I was being taken away from the world that I know, and I felt reconnected to the world that I didn't know. I felt like I was being put back in the world, but I was given a fresh perspective on life. I could look at the world from a different perspective, like the world was new and strange to me, like I was a newborn baby.
