 Portal 2, a game that I've played for a few years now. It's a FPS that's been adapted into an interactive art piece for the internet. It was originally created by Valve to be an interactive iteration of the Valve game Portal. The game itself is a very innovative game that has different art style elements that are very visually appealing to me. I've heard that the art piece is not for sale, but I haven't gotten around to buying it yet.
