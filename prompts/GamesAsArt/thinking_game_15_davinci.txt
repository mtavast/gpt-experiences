 "A Bird Story". It was a short, two-hour game that was released for free on Steam. It was a very small game with no dialog, so I think that's what made it art. I think that it was art because it made me feel something. I cried when I played it. It was about a boy and a bird, and the boy was deaf, so I think that this made me feel something special about how the boy felt. He felt alone and sad. You could tell by how the boy looked at the bird that he thought it was beautiful. I think that it was about coming of age and love. I don't know, maybe that's just what I took out of it. It's hard to explain. But I think that the art style was beautiful. The colors were soft and I liked how everything was so clean.
