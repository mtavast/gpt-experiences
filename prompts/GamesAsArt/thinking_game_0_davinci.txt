 Thomas was Alone. The story of the game is very simple, and the graphics aren't that spectacular, but the game is still very engaging. Especially the first level, where the game gives you the very basic idea of how to play, but leaves you to figure out the rest of the puzzles on your own. It is a game that is incredibly easy to pick up, but also incredibly hard to master. I think what makes this game an example of art is the story it tells. The game starts with a narrator talking about Thomas, a rectangle, who is the main character of the game. He has no friends because he is a rectangle, and no one likes to play with rectangles. This, I think, is the perfect example of the game working with its minimalist graphics, and making a fine story.
