 I'll do my best to explain the experience in detail. Well, there is this game called Journey. It is a game where you play as a traveler, a nameless traveler, and you travel though the desert. You travel alone, but there is an NPC, a monk of sorts, who travels with you. He is created by the developers, and you can see him on your screen. The point of the game is to reach a mountain in the distance. You travel across sand dunes, jump over deep canyons, ride on the back of a giant bird, slay monsters, get power-ups, and so on. The game is actually very beautiful, and it has a really immersive world. The visuals are stunning and the game really feels alive, as you can see the sun setting and rising, and the shadows of the sun on the sand. There is an ambient soundtrack in the background, and you can even sing with other players, which is great.
