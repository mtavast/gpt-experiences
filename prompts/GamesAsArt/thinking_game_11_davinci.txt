 'Koyaanisqatsi: Life out of Balance' (1982), directed by Godfrey Reggio. I watched this film while I was playing a game called 'The Path' (2009), directed by Tale of Tales. Both of these experiences were in the context of an art exhibition and the 'Koyaanisqatsi' film was shown in a dark room with a big screen. It was very impressive to see the film projected on the big screen, it was beautiful and the sound was amazing in the dark environment of the room. The game itself was very atmospheric and I felt like I was playing a low-budget horror movie, but I think it was very appropriate for the film. The game was very atmospheric and it fit very well with the film, it created a very interesting experience.
