 One of the most powerful game experiences I ever had, was playing Journey for the first time. It's the only game that made me really emotional. I have played a lot of games, but the emotional involvement with Journey was something I had never experienced before. It felt so unique. It's a game that has a very simple story, but in the end it's a story of friendship and companionship. That's something that you hardly ever see in video games, and I was really touched. The fact that you are thrown into this experience with a random stranger and you can only communicate through a handful of gestures, really makes you feel like you are making a connection with someone. I think the experience of playing Journey is special because it's a game that's focused on the player having a certain type of experience, and I think that's something that is unique to video games. There is really nothing like it.
