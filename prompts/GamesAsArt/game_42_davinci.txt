 Well, I don't think I have any particular example that stands out, but I think experiencing a video game as art is when you are very involved in what is going on in the game. You are on the edge of your seat, and you are making choices that impact the game in some way. The best games are the ones that make you feel a part of the game and not just someone watching a story play out. The sense of accomplishment you get from being able to do something in a game is what makes you feel like you have created something or have helped with the creation of something. That is what I think it means to experience a game as art.
