 It was a game called "Pac-Man". I was playing it, and I was tired, and it was raining, and I was hungry. I was so hungry that a friend helped me to go to the bathroom. I think it was the first time I had ever been hungry. It was a really good game. I liked it so much that I just wanted to go play it again every day. I used to go to the bathroom every day so my friend could play it and I could always feel good. Then, one day, I went to the bathroom, and I saw this alienâ€¦ it was a blue alien, and it was the only one in the whole video game world. I was really excited. I really wanted to go play it again, so I could feel good again. And that was that. That was it. I didn't play it again.
