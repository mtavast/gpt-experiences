 I have not had a specific experience where I can say "this was art". I've had experiences in which I considered the game art, but that was not the focus of my enjoyment. In particular I thought that the game Ico was art. The feeling I had in that game, the feeling of the world, of the character, was almost like being in an art movie. The atmosphere, the loneliness, the way the character and the world interacted together was very artistic in my eyes.
