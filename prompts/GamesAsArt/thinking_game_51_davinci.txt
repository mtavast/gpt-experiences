 "Tetris". I think of it as a perfect game. It's easy to learn, yet hard to master. It's simple yet beautiful. It's fun to play and it's fun to watch someone else play. It's a great challenge to get a high score. And it's a great feeling when you do. I remember when I first played it and got to level 10. What is interesting about that is that I played it about 20 years ago, yet I still remember the feeling of mastering it like it was yesterday. That is why I think of it as art.
