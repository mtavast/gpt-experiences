 Journey (2012). I've played it on PS3 and I've been really amazed by the experience. I really enjoyed the sound and the atmosphere, the feeling of loneliness and mystery. I think that the game is a masterpiece of art and I really love it. I feel that the game has a message and I believe that the game is trying to make you feel the loneliness of the character. I feel a deep connection with the game and I believe that the game has a message about the journey of life, a meaningful message about the meaning of life. It is a short game, but I easily spent 6 hours in it because I wanted to know the meaning of the game.
