 "The Last of Us" on the PlayStation 3. There is a part where you can see for the first time the destroyed city, and you can see the fallen buildings and the empty streets. You can see the dust, the destruction, and the emptiness. It was like you are a part of a movie. You are seeing a real tragedy, and you can feel the sadness. The game stayed with me for a long time.
