 The Last of Us, I think of it as art. The way it's made is so beautiful, you can see the care and effort that went into making it. It's like a painting, but of a world. The colors are vibrant and alive, the music is well composed and beautiful, the characters are amazing. It's a little bit like a novel, but more like a movie.
