 Fez. I've never experienced a game like that. It's not just that it grabs you and sucks you in. It has a style that's hard to describe. The game Fez is not like any other game I've played. It's not just a platformer, but it's a platformer with a lot of other elements. It's a platformer with some puzzle and some adventure elements. It's also a platformer in which you can change the view of the world. You can flip the world with the press of a button. I think this is something that's never been done in a game like this. You can also rotate the world as if you were looking at it from the corner.
