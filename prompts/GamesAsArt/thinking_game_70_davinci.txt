 Journey. How the game works as a whole, the world that it creates, the music, I'm thinking of it as art. It's something that was made with a lot of passion and I can feel it while playing. The game creates a beautiful environment that makes you feel like you are in some kind of dream. It has a very unique feeling to it that I have not experienced in any other game. It makes me feel very calm and peaceful. It's an amazing experience that I would love to feel again.
