 I got to play a game called Dear Esther. The game was very strange. I was taken aback by its presentation at first, but I figured it was just one of those artsy games that tries to do something different. It was the story and the music that really sold me. It was the story of a manâ€™s life and his journey through it. The game started with a voice over describing the island you would be exploring. The narrator was a man, who was talking about the island, like it was a person. His voice was calm and quiet, but it was very clear and distinct. It felt like he was talking to me. The graphics were very simple, but each scene moved in a way that made me feel I was on a real island. I felt like I was exploring a place I had never been to before. The music was a choral piece that was very soothing, but it still sounded beautiful and sad. I could feel the emotion and the passion in the music. I was very moved by the game. It was the best experience I have ever had in a game. I would say it felt like a beautiful painting, but it was more than that. It felt like I was walking through a memory.
