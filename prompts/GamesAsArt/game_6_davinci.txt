 A lot of times I might just want to play a video game that doesn't necessarily have a story or any message that I might find important or worth remembering. A game like this is a lot of fun to play, but it's just a game. It's not art. I have to be able to remember it. That is my main criteria for something being "art". I think this was one of the main reasons I didn't like Shadow of the Colossus so much. It was just fun to play, but I couldn't remember it.
