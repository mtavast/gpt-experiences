 The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. It was the first time I played a game and have such a strong emotional reaction to it. I was so overwhelmed and distraught by the end of the game that I had to stop playing. It took me several days to complete it because I couldn't bear to continue. I would say that this game was art because it made you so emotionally invested in the characters actions and the consequences of those actions. It was very realistic and the art style was very well done. It made you feel like you were actually in the game and that's something that I've rarely, if ever, felt like with a game.
