 A game that I felt is art is the recently released "Prey" by Arkane Studios. The game is set in a near future (2032) aboard the Talos I space station. The player takes on the role of Morgan Yu, a human aboard the Talos I space station. After a meteor strike, the station is attacked by aliens. The player must survive the alien onslaught by using the station's tools and technology. The player can upgrade with neuromods. The technology allows the user to upgrade their skills, abilities, and even change their DNA. The game is a first-person shooter. It also has RPG elements.

We are using technology to advance and become more powerful, e.g. nanotechnology, biological enhancement, and artificial intelligence. The game is also set in a highly realistic setting. The universe of the game is a near future where the player can upgrade his/her character's abilities. This is analogous to our near future.
