 Journey. I never had played any game like this before and I didn't know anything about the game except that it looked beautiful. When I started playing it I was just shocked over how beautiful and emotional the game was. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was like I was watching a movie and at the same time I was playing it. I was a part of the story and it was like it was happening to me. I was so deeply connected to the game that it was like I had entered a different world. It was so hard to tell where the game ended and I began. After playing it for a few hours I was so moved that I felt like there was a story behind the game and I wanted to know it. So I started to look into it but I couldn't find anything. There was nothing to read about the game, it was just a game. This made me more interested in the game. I was so moved by the game that I wanted to know more about it. That's when I realized that I experienced the game as art.
