 Journey. It is a very short and simple game. It's a game that deals with a lot of themes and feelings that I've experienced in life. It's only a few hours long but it feels like a whole experience. It deals with themes of longing, loneliness, and death. It's a game where you can meet other players online in a completely random fashion. You can't communicate with them, and you have no idea who's playing. But you can form a bond with the other players. A bond that lasts even after you stop playing.
