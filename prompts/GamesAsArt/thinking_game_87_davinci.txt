 Ico, developed by Team Ico and released in 2001 on the PS2. It is considered by many to be a work of art. Ico is a third person adventure game with puzzle elements and platforming. The game is set in a castle and dungeons, the player controls a young boy (Ico) and a mysterious girl (Yorda).

The puzzles are there to slow the player down, as the castle is crawling with giants that will crush you if you walk in their line of sight. The player has to lead Yorda through the castle without being seen by the giants, or Yorda will die. The game is very linear, but there is one area where the player has to move a block and a tower to reach the top of the castle, and the player can go back to the bottom of the castle, after reaching the top, the player can't go back to the top, so the player has to move the block and the tower before reaching the top. Ico is a very emotional game, there is no dialogue, everything is shown through the environment and the music. As you can see below, the player is in a cage with Yorda, the giants are in the cage with you, the player has to jump over a metal bar to get to a lever that will release you from the cage, but the player has to leave Yorda behind, the giants are in the way, you can choose to leave Yorda behind or you can try to go back to her, if you do, you will get crushed, if you don't, you will still get crushed, if you leave her behind, the game shows Yorda crying over your death, after that, you will have to go back to the cage, because the lever that will release you from the cage is on the other side of the cage, so you have to go back from where you came, you will see Yorda's mom, who is a giant, talk to Yorda, then the player has to move the block and the tower, after reaching the top, the player can see the castle from the top of the castle, the player can see Yorda's mom from the top of the castle, if yo
