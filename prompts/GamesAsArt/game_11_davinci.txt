 I had an amazing experience with Journey (2012). It is a short game with an artistic style that is different from any other game I've seen before. It is beautiful to look at and has a beautifully crafted score. I enjoyed the subtle story that was told and the sense of companionship I felt with the other players in my game. The game is not very challenging, it's fairly easy to play. My favorite part of the game was the end, when you go to the mountaintop and you see the sun rising. That moment was beautiful.
