 The artwork is the first thing that I noticed. The way that it was made and the skills of the artist were amazing. I never experienced something like this before. The colors were so vibrant and beautiful. I think the most amazing thing was that you could interact with it in so many different way. It became like a living part of myself, an extension of my soul.
