 called "The Last of Us", which I played in 2012, I think. It was an action-adventure game, set in a post-apocalyptic world. The game had a beautiful and melancholic atmosphere, it was filled with symbols and metaphors. I was playing the game with my friend, we were both already fans of the genre, and we were both deeply touched by this game for different reasons.
