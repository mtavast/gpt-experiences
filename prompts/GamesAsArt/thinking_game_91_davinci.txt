 The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It is an open world RPG in which you can literally get lost in the world for hours. I have played through the game about four times altogether. Every time I play it, I am filled with awe of the artistic achievement that this game is. The graphics are on par with some of the best looking movies at the time of its release. There are many different landscapes, each of which is more beautiful than the next. There are little details that really make the world come alive, such as birds flying overhead and butterflies fluttering around. The creators of this game really put a lot of time and effort into the world, and it really shows. The game is so large and immersive that it really feels like a living breathing world.
