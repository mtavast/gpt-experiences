 I never considered a game as art before I played "Gone Home". It is a first person video game by Fullbright released in 2013. It's a game about finding out what happened to your family. The whole way of playing is exploring the house and reading the notes. There is no fighting or solving puzzles. I think what makes it art, is the environment. When you walk around and read the notes, you feel like you are in the house. There are sounds from the rain outside. The kitchen is messy and the dinner is still on the table. The notes reveal details about the family. You feel like you are reading someone's diary. It's like a story, where you are a part of it.
