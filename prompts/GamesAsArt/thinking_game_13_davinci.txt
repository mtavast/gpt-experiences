 Journey. The experience I had was one of wonder and awe. I had never seen anything like it. It's a game about a monk that is trying to illuminate a mountain. There are no enemies, no violence and no dialogue. The game is about exploration and finding the light. This game was one of the most beautiful things I have ever played.
