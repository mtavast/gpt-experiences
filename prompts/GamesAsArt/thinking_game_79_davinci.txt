 Journey on the Playstation. I was really taken by the striking visual style and music. I think what really brought it home for me was the fact that you don't play as a character, you are the character. It was really cool, to me, to be able to just explore this beautiful environment. I enjoyed just watching the little sand creatures I encountered. It was like I was just there, a part of this world.
