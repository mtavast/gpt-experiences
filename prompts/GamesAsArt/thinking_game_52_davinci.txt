 Journey, developed by thatgamecompany. It's a game where you play as a robed character in a desert, exploring this vast world. The music, the environments, and the story are all symbolic of what it means to be human, to be alive. I consider Journey as art because you explore and experience this vast new world, the music and the environments all serve to teach you about yourself. It is also a game that is simple to play, but difficult to master. I love that about it.
