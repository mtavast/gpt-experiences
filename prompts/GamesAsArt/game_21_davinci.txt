 I have to think of a game that I really enjoyed playing. Since I play a lot of video games, this is hard. I enjoyed playing The Last of Us. This game was an adventure game with a great storyline. In the beginning, I was very curious what happened to the world and how the world would be in the future. The creators of the game did a great job in creating a horrific futuristic world. The graphics of the game were outstanding and very realistic.
