 I consider games as art, when a game is able to create a certain atmosphere, an emotion, a feeling, a picture in your mind, which makes you go into an altered state of consciousness. An example of this would be the game Limbo. It's a 2D side scrolling platform game, which has been developed by the Danish Studio Playdead. The game is very simple. You control a boy in a forest, you need to get to the end, but there are a lot of deadly traps, which can kill you. There's no blood in the game, but the atmosphere is very dark and eerie.
