 I have two experiences, both of which were created by the same developer. The first one was in a game called Journey. It was pretty early in the morning, and I was playing alone. I had only played for about 10 minutes when I realized that I was playing something that was truly different. The game is a very simple platformer, but the environment is so beautiful that it was more like an experience than a game. The second experience was in a game called Inside. It was a game about a boy who had to escape from a factory. It is very dark, and at the end, there is a scene where you see the boy standing on a platform, and he falls. What made me consider it as "art" was that the whole game is focused on the boy trying to escape, and you know that he can't. But at the end, you realize that the boy is just an object, and that he was only used to tell a bigger story about the world, and the world that the boy wanted to escape was this factory. It's a very dark game, but maybe it's not so dark, because the boy is not the one who is doing bad things, but he is just trying to survive.
