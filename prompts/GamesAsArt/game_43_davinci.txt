 Well, I played a game that was supposed to be very dark and scary. It was a kind of psychological horror game. The game has a very dark tone to it, so much that it made me feel uncomfortable. The game felt like a nightmare. It was a nightmare. I was in a dark forest, trying to find my way out, but instead of finding my way out I had to kill a lot of people. I was just walking through the forest and suddenly I was like "what the hell is going on here?". Then I was killing a lot of people and there were monsters all around me. It was the most horrible experience of my life. I felt a lot of fear and anxiety. I was in shock afterwards. It was the most horrible experience I ever had.
