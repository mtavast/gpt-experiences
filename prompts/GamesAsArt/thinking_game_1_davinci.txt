 Journey. I was curious to how it would be like to play Journey, so I decided to give it a try. I had never seen a game like that before, with that kind of graphic and music. It was a very beautiful experience. I felt that the music in the game did not do any harm to the experience. It played along with my feelings while playing the game. I was a very emotional experience. I decided to play the game because of its art design, the music and the environment.
