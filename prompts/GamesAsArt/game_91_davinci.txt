 In my experience, I think that some games are a work of art, for example one game I played was Journey. This game had a very unique and beautiful art style, the music was also very relaxing and it had a very creepy atmosphere. Another game I played which was a work of art, was called Dear Esther. The game had an interesting story line and had a very unique art style, which made the game very enjoyable to play.
