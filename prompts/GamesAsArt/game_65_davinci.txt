 Alright, I will try. The game I am about to describe is Journey by thatgamecompany, released in 2012. I played the game with my fianc√©, and we both had a similar experience. The game is about two things: finding a way to a mountain and experiencing the surrounding environment. In order to reach the mountain, the player has to find hidden passages and pieces of cloth, which are the game's "prizes". The cloth is used to make a scarf, which is necessary to progress through the game.
