 Journey, which is a game that I played in 2013. The game is about an anonymous player, who is represented with a robed figure, traveling across a barren desert. The goal of the game is to reach a mountain in the distance. It is a game about exploration, about following the path, about leaving a mark. The player is alone, but sometimes comes across other players on the way. While there is no direct interaction, you can see other players as white figures in the distance. These other players are not anonymous, but are represented by their Playstation Network accounts. The goal of the game is to reach a mountain in the distance.
