 Ok, here is a game experience that I would consider as art: World of Warcraft. I played World of Warcraft for a few years, pretty intensely. I have made a lot of friends through that game. We have a lot of fun together and we are connected by the game. I think it is art because there are a lot of people who work very hard to make such a virtual world possible. The game has a story and a lot of history. It is really an experience to play this game. Some people look at it as a waste of time, but I can imagine how a game like this can be art. It is not a book, a painting or a movie, but it is a way to tell stories. I didn't experience a game like that before.
