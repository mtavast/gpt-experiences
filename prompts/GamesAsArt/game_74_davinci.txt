 Actually, I don't remember a game that I would call art in the sense of a painting or a movie. But I remember games that had a strong artistic style or concept, that I enjoyed for the very reason that they tried to convey a message. For example, I really like the game "Destroy all humans" because it had a very ironic tone and a weird concept. Also, I liked the game "The last of us", because it made me feel how it is to be a parent, and it made me think about the importance of family. These games really made me think, and I enjoyed being challenged by their message.
