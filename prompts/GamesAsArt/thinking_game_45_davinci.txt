 "Gone Home" to describe my point. This game was made by The Fullbright Company and released in 2013. This game is about the story of a young woman (Kaitlin Greenbriar) who returns from a vacation abroad and finds out that her family is not at home. The whole story is in the form of a diary written by Kaitlin.
