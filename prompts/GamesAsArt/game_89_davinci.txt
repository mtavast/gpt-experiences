 I have a clear memory of finishing a game and feeling pretty empty afterwards. It was the end of a long and, perhaps, "unreal" experience. To be honest, I didn't know what to do with myself. I didn't know what I wanted to do next. I felt empty and I think that feeling was because I had invested a lot into this game. It was an experience that I shared with friends and it was an experience that I deeply cared about. It was like a good book ending and I didn't know what to do with myself. I remember thinking "what do I do after this?" and "how can I keep this feeling going?" It was a feeling of emptiness.
