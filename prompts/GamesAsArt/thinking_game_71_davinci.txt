 Journey by thatgamecompany. I will try to explain why I believe this game to be art. The game is probably best described as a walking simulator. You play as a robed figure and must travel across a desert by walking and occasionally flying. The game is a journey of self-discovery of the character, and of the player as well. The goal of the game is to make it to the end in one piece, and to do that you must discover the landscape and interact with the creatures that live in it. The game is very simple, yet it does so much with what it has. The way it sets you free to explore the world, to discover it and its inhabitants at your own pace, and to do what you feel like, is something I have not experienced in any other game. This freedom, combined with the game's stunning visuals and the soothing ambient soundtrack, makes for an incredibly moving experience. I believe that the game's overall theme is a journey of self-discovery, and you, the player, are the one discovering it. Because of the game's structure and the way it lets you take your own pace, the journey is unique for every player. It is a journey through the desert to a mountain, and a journey through your own mind and memories. It is a journey of discovery of both the world of the game and the player's own self. It is a journey of self-discovery and growth. I think most of the value of the game comes from this unique experience. The game is not a collection of different levels or objectives; you are free to explore the game's world as you choose.
