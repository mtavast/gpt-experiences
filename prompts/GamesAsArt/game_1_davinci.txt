 I experienced a game as art when I was a child. I was in my early teens. There was a relatively new game in the arcade. It was a horror game. I was a huge fan of horror movies and so I was very excited about this game. The player character was a woman in a nightgown, and she had to walk from one side of the screen to the other. The screen was split in half by a wall. To get past each half of the screen you had to step over the wall. The woman could be killed in the game by zombies, ghosts, and other monsters. As she walked, she would be chased by different monsters. If she could not get over the wall, she would be killed.
