 I began to play The Last of Us, a Playstation 3 game on Playstation 4. At first I was very confused, and my confusion was shared by many reviewers and other players. This game is not the typical game that people would play. It is a game that has no clear direction or purpose. You play as Joel, a middle-aged man with a teenage girl named Ellie. You travel together and fight against groups of infected people who try to kill you. I didn't know what to do. I died many times. This game is not fun. It is not entertaining. It is not like all the other games that I play.
