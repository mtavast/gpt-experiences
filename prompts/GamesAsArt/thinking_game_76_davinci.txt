 that I've played the most in my life. I can't remember the exact name, but it was about the end of the world, or, rather, about the end of the world as we know it. It was a strategy game, where I was the leader of a small group of survivors. I had to survive for as long as I could. I had to keep my people alive, I had to keep them healthy, I had to keep them fed. I had to keep the most important knowledge safe, and I had to keep the hope alive. I had to keep my people together, because if they became unhappy or if they became weak, they would die.
