 I started playing the game with a friend of mine. We were both pretty excited to play because we had heard so much about it. We started playing and were both pretty surprised by the story. It felt so different from every other story we had ever heard in a video game. We got to a point in the game where we got to explore the world and see the sights. We were just awestruck by all of the art the developers put into the game. It was so different from every other game we had played. The colors were vibrant and there were so many details everywhere. We had never seen anything like it before.
