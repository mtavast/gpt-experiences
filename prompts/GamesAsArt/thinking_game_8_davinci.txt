 Journey. I was struck by how different the experience is when compared to playing other games. I was alone in a big desert, and it was just me and the music. I felt like I was on a road trip with a friend, and it was so enjoyable. The music was beautiful, and I was in awe. I had the same emotions you would have when experiencing art in real life. I wanted to stop and listen to the music for a while, and I did not feel the need to move on any faster.
