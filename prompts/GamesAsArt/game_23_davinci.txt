 I will try to explain my thoughts and feelings as best as I can. I believe I experienced a digital game as art when I played a particular level in the first-person shooter game Half-Life 2. This level is called "Follow Freeman!" and is the fifth chapter of the game. It is set in a part of the city of City 17 that is being attacked by the Combine (the antagonistic force in the Half-Life series), and the player has to move through the streets as quickly as possible while being attacked by a relatively high number of enemies.
