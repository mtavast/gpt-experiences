 Journey by thatgamecompany. I remember playing it on a friend's Playstation 3, and feeling of immenseness and beauty, being surrounded by sand dunes and watching the sun set just made me think of how beautiful life can be. The music was also great and I remember just sitting and listening to it. There were no enemies, no real objectives, just a sense of wonder and freedom. Just watching the sun set and feeling the breeze was something I will never forget.
