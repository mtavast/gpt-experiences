 NieR, which I played this year. I had never played any of the games that came out in the Drakengard series, and when I started playing NieR, I didn't know what to expect. The visual style was mesmerizing, and the music was absolutely beautiful. I loved the story, the characters, and the premise of the game. I loved everything about it. I was really surprised by the game, and I thought it was extremely well done.
