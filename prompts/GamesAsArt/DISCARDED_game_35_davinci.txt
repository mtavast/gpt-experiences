 It was a very personal experience. I was playing a video game and it felt like I was part of the game. I was the game. I was taken to another place, another dimension. A world where I existed and where I was present. I was not the observer but the observed. Everything was different. My perception was slightly distorted. The colours were brighter. Everything was clear. I was there in the game, experiencing the world.
