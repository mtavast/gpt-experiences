 Journey by thatgamecompany and how it made me feel. It was a beautiful experience, the game was so peaceful and it was very relaxing. The colors were very vibrant and it was very simple in its design. I think that game was very metaphorical and it made me think about my life. It made me feel very relaxed and it was a well made game. I feel that it was art because it was very simple, but it had a lot of meaning behind it. It was like a work of art that could be interpreted into many different ways.
