 [I] noticed a lot of information about the game and its mechanics that I didnâ€™t know before. But then I always felt there was a lot of "stuff" that was missing in the game. I felt like there was a very personal story that was presented to me and that there was a lot of information that wasn't being presented to me. I felt like it was very important to uncover the information that was in the game. It was very hard to put into words what I felt was missing because I felt so strongly about it.
