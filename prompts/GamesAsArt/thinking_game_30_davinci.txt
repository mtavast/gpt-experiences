 Journey. I played this game on the PlayStation 3. It was late in the evening, I was lying in bed, and I had my headphones on. I had just come back from a stressful day at work and school and I was in no mood to do anything but perhaps sleep, but I knew I had to make a move. So I turned on the PS3 and the game loaded. I started a new game and Journey awaited me. I didn't know what to expect, I had never played a video game like this, so I was intrigued. I started out by myself in a wasteland, with a mountain in the distance. I didn't know where to go, so I went along the path. There was a mountain range in the distance and there was a sandstorm in front of me, so I made my way in between the two. I walked and walked until I reached the desert. There were some ruins in the distance, so I made my way toward them. Once I got close enough to the ruins, I saw a red scarf flying in the wind. So I made my way toward it. I followed the scarf in the desert and it led me to a gate, so I made my way toward the gate. I pulled the gate open and it was a cave. I walked into the cave and I was greeted by a woman who was singing a song. I looked around and saw a glowing white light. I followed the light and it led me to the top of the mountain. I made my way to the top of the mountain and the woman was there, singing to me. I was in awe of the beauty of the song. I was mesmerized by it. I followed the woman and she led me to the gate. I opened the gate and it was a desert. I followed the red scarf through the desert, and it led me to a city. I walked through the city and I made my way to the top of the city. I was in awe of the beauty of the city. I made my way through the city and I saw a glowing white light. I followed the white light and it led me to a tunnel. Once I got through the tunnel, there was a beautiful garden and a palace. I walked through the garden and made my way through a door. I walked into the palace and I was in an amphitheater. There was a stage in the center of the amphitheater and a woman was singing on the stage
