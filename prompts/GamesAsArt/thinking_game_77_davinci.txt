 Journey. It's a 2D game where you are literally walking on a path in a desert with some mountains in the background. It's a beautiful game with an amazing soundtrack. You play with a random player online, and when you are walking on the path and you meet another player, you can't see his/her face but you can communicate with them by singing together. The song is introduced by the game itself and it's one of those songs you hear in a church, but it's a bit more melancholic, and it's played with a flute. This song is also played when you find an object that allows you to fly a bit on your scarf. I think it's the only way you can fly in the game. To me, it's so beautiful and peaceful, I feel like I'm in a dream. I love how this game has the feeling of a certain piece of art. I'm thinking of the game Journey.
