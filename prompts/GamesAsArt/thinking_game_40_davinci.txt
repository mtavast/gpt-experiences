 The Path. We played it in the context of a design course I was taking. I think it was the first 3D game I played, and it was very different from any game I had played before. It was slow, you had to explore the game world and you had to stay in this world for a long time. While playing it I felt like I had to submerge myself into the game. It was very immersive. That's why I think of The Path as art.
