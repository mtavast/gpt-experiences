 I would describe an art experience as something that's grandiose or that captures a lot of emotion. It's something that you feel a lot, something that brings out a lot of emotion. It's something that you just feel like you need to think about and you need to experience. It's something that you can't really explain. It's something that you just feel, and you need to feel. That's what I would describe as an art experience.
