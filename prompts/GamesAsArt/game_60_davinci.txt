 Ok, I will try to explain this, but there are some things I still do not understand myself. I am a seventeen year old boy. I have been playing video games since I was a little child. I have been playing them since I learned how to use a control, and I plan to continue playing them until I can no longer move my fingers. I have played many different genres, and I enjoy them all. I am not going to tell you which games I have played, because it is not really important for this interview. But I will tell you one thing. One of the first games I ever played, the one that really sparked my interest in gaming, is Super Mario Bros.
