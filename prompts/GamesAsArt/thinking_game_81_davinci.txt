 Max Payne 3. I played this game for a long time, sometimes 10 hours a day. I really got into it, so I played it almost every day for about 3 months. During this time I played it every day, and I enjoyed it. It was art because it was a work of genius and a creative master piece. It was a story about a man who went through a lot in his life and how he set things right.
