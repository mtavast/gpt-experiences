 Journey, a lot of people regard as art. I agree with this view. I experienced this game as a very emotional and touching experience. This is because the game makes the player feel a lot of empathy and the player is forced to rely on the other player. Both game mechanics and the environment made me feel very emotional. For example, the music and the environment create a feeling of unity and togetherness, and the mechanics of helping each other through the difficult terrain are very touching to the player.
