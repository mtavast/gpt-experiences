 The Long Dark. I first played it a few years ago, and I remember that I experienced a sense of calmness while playing. I was intrigued by the game's world, and it's mechanics were easy to understand. The game's creator, Raphael van Lierop, even said that the game was a "survival sandbox" first and foremost, meaning that it's first purpose was to be a sandbox where you can experience the world and play with the mechanics in many different ways. That's exactly what I did. I wanted to know how the character reacts when I do this, or that. I wanted to know how the environment reacts to a certain action or a certain combination of actions. I wanted to know how the game reacts to me, and what happens when I do the same thing over and over again. I wanted to explore, to experiment, and to get a feeling for what can be done and what was not possible. I wanted to feel what the world of the game was like, and why it was like that.
