 The first game I can remember experiencing as art was "This War of Mine". It was different from other games we play, as it didn't have action. It used a different type of storytelling and the gameplay was designed to explore the characters' feelings and decision-making. It used different types of emotions such as fear, sadness, and hope, which I haven't seen in any other game.
