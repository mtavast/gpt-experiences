 Journey. Journey is a very simple game, with very simple mechanics and it doesn't give you a huge amount of things to do, and it is very short. You play as a character in a white robe, you run, jump and glide. Your goal is to reach the summit. There are no enemies in this game, no puzzles and no other people playing with you. For me, this game is an experience of art. The way the game looks and sounds and the way it makes you feel.
