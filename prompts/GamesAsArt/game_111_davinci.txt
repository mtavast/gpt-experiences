 I will take as an example a game I played for the first time just a few days ago: "Gone Home". It is a first-person game, set in an old house that has been recently bought by a family. The player steps in the shoes of Kaitlin, the youngest daughter of the family. The player has to explore the house to unveil the story. The house looks like it has been abandoned for a few weeks, but it is actually the player who has taken up the role of Kaitlin, so the player is actually visiting her home. There are various items scattered around the house, and some of them are related to the story. The player has to play with items, read the notes the family left around the house, listen to the messages on the answering machine and so on. The game has a very strong narrative, and it focuses on its characters and their lives. The player has to try to be Kaitlin and to experience her life. The player has to walk around the house, listen to various messages or even watch a video. It is a very strong experience, and it makes the player think about the characters. The game has many interesting things to offer, and it is a very good example of using a game as art.
