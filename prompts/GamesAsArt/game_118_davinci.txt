 The first time I played "Hotline Miami" I just thought it was an awesome game, the music was amazing and the gameplay was fun and addicting. It wasn't until after I finished the game that I realized that everything in the game had meaning, nothing was there without a purpose. It all reflected the inner turmoil of the main character, the music was constantly changing as you progressed through the game, it was all connected to the storyline, there were a few levels where you literally went crazy and started screaming and the only way you could progress was by killing everyone around you. The game was dark and gritty, but it still had some sense of beauty to it.
