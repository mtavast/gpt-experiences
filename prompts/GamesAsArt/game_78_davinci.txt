 I would have to say that Journey by thatgamecompany is the first game that I have ever played that has really made me think and feel something. I am not a huge gaming fan. I play a game here and there, but I have never really got into gaming. One day I was surfing the net and came across this game that claimed to be a game that was like nothing I have ever played before. It appealed to me because it claimed to be a game that was not about killing, but about helping others and getting along with others. I decided to buy the game and give it a try. I was amazed at how beautiful the game was. The colors were spectacular and the music was amazing. I felt like I was actually in the game. I liked the way that the game moved me to help others and to be a good person. It was really refreshing to play a game that was not about killing everyone. I have been playing it a lot and I am so glad that I decided to try it. The only thing that I don't like about the game is that it is kind of short and I wish there was more to the game. I know that is what the devs said they were going for, but it is still kind of a bummer that it is so short.
