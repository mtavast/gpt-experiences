 I was playing a game that I had been playing for weeks. It was a game that was so different from the games I normally play, because it was so hard. It was a game that challenged me and I was forced to struggle, but I loved it. It was a new experience for me. I don't think I have ever been challenged in this way by a game before. It was something new and I was so happy about that. I also felt like I was closer to the characters, I felt like I knew them. They felt like they were my friends. I wanted to get to know them better, I felt like I was becoming closer to them. I wanted to feel as though I was part of their world. I felt like I was struggling with them and I could understand their pain. It felt like I was living the game with them. I was experiencing this game as art. I was so close to the characters and I think it was because of the fact that the game was so hard that I felt this way. I felt as though we were in it together. I felt like we were struggling together and we were becoming more close. I wanted to help them. I wanted to cheer them on and I wanted to see them succeed.
