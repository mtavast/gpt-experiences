 "The Path" by Tale of Tales. It's a walking simulator that's a little hard to describe. It's a game where you play as a girl, walking down a forest path with a lantern. You have to walk from your home to the grandmother's house, but there are other paths you can take and mysteries you can explore if you choose to. You're afraid of something, and you have to choose what to do. I remember that I first played it alone, it was night and I was in the dark, I had my headphones on and turned off all the lights in my room. I just walked down the path, and I started to think about my life, about my goals and fears, and I felt like the girl in the game. It was as if I was actually there, walking the path, thinking about my life. I could feel the atmosphere, the sounds, the graphics, like it was real. The game has a very dark, rough, moody atmosphere, and it really makes you think about what's going on. It makes you feel like you're the character, and it's not just something "fun" that you're doing, the game makes you think about your life, and that's what art does. I felt like I was really taking a walk down a path in the woods, and that's what art does.
