 I have experienced art in games before. I think the first time I ever did was in a game called "The Stanley Parable". It was an experimental game. It was a game that made me think about the way that I play games, and it was a game that had a lot of humor to it. In the game, you play as Stanley, and you are in his office. It is the day of his termination from his job. He has a choice to make. He can either quit, or he can stay. The goal of the game is to choose what Stanley wants to do. He has a conversation with a narrator that is supposed to guide him through his options. The narrator tries to get Stanley to stay, but Stanley chooses to quit. He quits his job because he doesn't want to work for a company that doesn't care about him. Then the narrator tells him that he has done a good job, and that he can leave. Stanley walks out of his office with a happy ending. After the game is over, you can play it again. When it starts, Stanley is in his office. The narrator tells him to make a choice. Stanley now has a choice to make. He can either walk out of the door, or he can quit. This time, he chooses to walk out of the door, and the narrator tells him that he has made a bad choice. Then, the narrator tells the player that they have made a bad choice. This is very interesting to me. It makes me think about the way that I play games. It is a game about the choices that we make, and what we do to make a good or bad choice.
