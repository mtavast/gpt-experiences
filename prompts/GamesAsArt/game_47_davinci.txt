 I have a habit of thinking of games as objects as art. I'm thinking of them as objects, like sculptures, paintings, books. Maybe even physical objects. I'm thinking of them as objects of art because they have some features that are art. They have originality, they try to be meaningful and have a message. They're crafted with care and with love. They have artistic value. They're interesting to look at and they're interesting to think about. They're also important. People spend a lot of time making them and playing them. People do things for the sake of the enjoyment these games bring them. They're also some kind of art because they can make you feel something and can make you think. They can touch your heart, make you cry, make you feel better, make you feel bad. They can make you think about things. They can make you connect with others. They can make you connect with yourself. They can make you think about things you wouldn't have thought about without them. They can speak to you on a personal level. They can make you understand other people that aren't like you. They can make you feel the way you might not have felt without them.
