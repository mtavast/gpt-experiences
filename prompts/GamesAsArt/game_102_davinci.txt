 I was playing Minecraft when I was a kid. I was building with friends and we were having a lot of fun. Then I started building a statue of my friend that looked exactly like him, that was how I wanted to build him. We were having fun and I was just imagining what I was doing. The feeling of building this statue was amazing. My friend was right there, amazed by what I was doing. I was imagining what I was doing, and I was imagining things that I wanted to do, and my mind was creating something that my hands were building. It felt like I was imagining this statue and I was building it in real life. The feeling that I got was incredible. I was immersed in the game and we were all having a lot of fun. I remember smiling a lot while I was building the statue. It was the first time I experienced video games as art.
