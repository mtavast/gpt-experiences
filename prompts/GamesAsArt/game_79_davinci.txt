 Sure, here's one of my favorite moments in gaming that I'd consider art. In The Last of Us, there is a particularly unsettling area where you enter an abandoned mall. It's the kind of place that has been taken over by nature and a feeling of dread. You see the aftermath of a brutal struggle between humans and infected. You see infected bodies, bloody hand prints on the walls, and blood on the elevator. The music is haunting and there are unsettling sounds coming from the area. It was a very powerful scene.
