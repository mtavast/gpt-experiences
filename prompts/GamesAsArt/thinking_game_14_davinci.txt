 Journey. I've just returned from college and had a lot of time for myself. I decided to go to a friend who lives in another town for the weekend. I took a late afternoon train. I had a lot of time to myself, so I decided to play some Journey. I was expecting to play a couple of hours, but I ended up playing the game for almost the entire trip. I got to the station and I was still playing the game. I was so immersed in the game that I didn't even notice that the train had stopped. I was so immersed in the game that I didn't even notice that people were getting off the train. I was so immersed in the game that I didn't even notice that I had arrived at the station. I was so immersed in the game that I didn't even notice the sun had already set. That experience was really special to me. I was so immersed in the game that I didn't even notice I was late. It was only when I noticed the dark streets that I decided to stop playing. I was so immersed in the game that I didn't even notice I had arrived at the station.
