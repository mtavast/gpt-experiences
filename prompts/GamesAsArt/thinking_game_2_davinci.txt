 Journey by Thatgamecompany. I think the art is a direct result of the story, which is that of a nameless traveller, who is exploring a world in search of purpose. The landscape is beautiful and ambiguous, and the music compliments the experience perfectly. It's a game that really resonates with the human condition, and I think it's a perfect example of the artistic potential of digital games.
