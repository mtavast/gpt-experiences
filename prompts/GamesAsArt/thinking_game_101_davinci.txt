 Super Mario 64. It was the first 3-dimensional game I played. I was still a child and I remember how amazed I was about the graphics and the new possibilities of movement in that game. I remember that I spent hours playing it. I also remember that I played it over and over again. I wanted to beat the game as fast as possible and I wanted to collect as many stars as possible. I wanted to see the whole game. I wanted to see the whole world. I guess I wanted to experience the whole world of that game. And I think that I managed to do so. I remember that I watched youtube videos about the shortcuts to beat the game as fast as possible and that I watched them over and over again. I remember that I watched all of the movies and documentaries about game design and game history. I watched them over and over again. And it is all because I wanted to experience that game as much as I could. I wanted to experience it as much as I could.
