 I feel a little uncomfortable writing about this, actually. I guess I should say I've been playing computer and video games for a long time, and I think I can say I have an understanding of the medium. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do enjoy playing games from time to time. In terms of art, though, I'm still a little hesitant to call video games art. There is a big difference between what I experience when I am playing a game and what I experience during other art forms such as movies, paintings, or music. I guess I would say that the reasons I have for calling games art are similar to the reasons some people would call movies art. I think when people call a movie art, they say it has a well-crafted plot, interesting characters, and a good soundtrack. These are all things I could say about games too.
