 I experienced this with games like Portal and Journey. It is a very simple design, but the experience is very emotional and the design of the game is so well done and innovative that it forces me to think about what kind of game I am actually playing. It is not a game like Doom or Call of Duty. It is not a game that has any kind of violence or destruction. It is a game that forces me to experience the world in a different way. It makes me think about the beauty of the world and the people I have met in my life. I think the main reason why I am able to experience this is because of the design of the game. It has some simple rules that guide me through the game, but I am still able to manipulate the world as I see fit. The game is not just about solving puzzles. It is also about learning about myself and my interaction with the world and other people.
