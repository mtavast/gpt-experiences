 Journey by Thatgamecompany. It was not directed at a story, but rather the feeling it evokes. It's a game about traveling, losing yourself, about finding yourself in other people, and about the feeling of freedom. It's a game about the feeling of being a stranger and finding a home in the world. It's also a game about the feeling of sadness and loneliness, and ultimately the feeling of being at peace with these things. It's a game about discovering something wonderful in the world and letting it go. It's a game about being with others, with strangers. It's a game about a thousand tiny details that makes up the grand picture. It's about the little things you notice in the world around you, which you might not otherwise notice.
