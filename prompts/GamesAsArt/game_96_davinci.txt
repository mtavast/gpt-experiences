 The first time I experienced art in a video game was when I fought for my life in the story mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops II. I was playing the part where you are trying to escape from an underground compound and I had to kill a lot of enemies. I was running down a hallway and I had to fight through a huge area with a lot of enemies. I had the chance to retreat, but I chose to fight on. I fought through the enemies and I was able to complete the mission and I got really emotional because I said "wow, I just made a choice to fight and I was able to do it! This is the power of video games!"
