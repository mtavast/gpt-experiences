 Journey. The game itself is not the sort of thing that I would usually play. The game is more about the experience of the journey to the mountain than the goal of reaching the mountain. You almost never see the other player, and if you do, you don't talk. You are alone in this game, and the experience of being alone in the desert with the sandstorm is very powerful. The music is also wonderful and creates a feeling of being in this game.
