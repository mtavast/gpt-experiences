 A game that stood out to me as art was Journey. This game has an abstract art style, and in the game, you play as a robed figure that is seemingly the only other person in the game's world. The player is given no instruction on how to play the game. My goal was to walk to the top of a mountain as I saw a light at the top of it. I trekked through the desert for hours, and at some point I felt like I was on the verge of death. I saw a figure and approached him/her, but the figure ran away. I was unable to catch up to him/her. I felt a sense of despair, and quickly got to the top of the mountain, where I was greeted by a crowd of people playing a flute. I felt joy, and played along. I felt that it was a beautiful way to end the game.
