 A while ago I was playing "Journey" by thatgamecompany. I was really into it, because it offered me a new experience. I felt that the game offered me a new experience, because I was playing with other people, but I didn't know who they were. It was an online multiplayer game, where you could only communicate with other players by using musical notes. The goal of the game was to reach the top of this mountain. It was a beautiful experience. I felt very emotional and focused on playing. For me it was art.
