It was a big game, but it was the first game I ever experienced in that way. I had never played a game like this before. It was an adventure game, but it was more like a game you played in a game store, so the graphics were very simple. It wasn't a very big game, so it was kind of hard to show them off. It would take me about 20 minutes to get used to the game. I just thought it was very rude to people playing on the same room as me. I never played a game like this before, so it was kind of hard to describe in a few words what it was like. I think the game had a lot of different levels, so I played all of them. I would go up a floor, and I would walk up a wall, and I would walk up a balcony. The only part of the game I remember is that there were two big doors. I think I spent a lot of time in a certain room. I don't remember what it was called, but it was like a different level, and I would walk up a different wall. I'm kind of familiar with the game right now, but it was a very big game, so I know I didn't have a lot of time to play it. I don't know if it is a video game or an art game, but it was very very important to me.\n\nResearcher: Were there any specific moments from the game that you remember that you were really impressed by?\n\nParticipant: No, I haven't heard of those.\n\nResearcher: How would you describe the game?

The game was like a lot of platformers, where you'd go up a wall and walk down a floor. There was a lot of jumping and stuff in the game, but it wasn't very complex. It was more of a puzzle game, and I kind of remember the game being more of a puzzle game than anything else. I think it was just a very hard game to explain, so I wouldn't call it a first person view. I think it was more of a platformer kind")
